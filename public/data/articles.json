      "content": "Ben SolakFeb 20, 2026, 06:35 AM ETCloseBen Solak joined ESPN in 2024 as a national NFL analyst. He previously covered the NFL at The Ringer, Bleeding Green Nation and The Draft Network.Multiple AuthorsEmailPrintOpen Extended ReactionsFebruary, March and April bring unbridled hope to every NFL fan base. We all fall in love with the same seven free agents and the same 15 draft sleepers. But team needs don't always line up with the players available in free agency, the trade market and the draft class. Each offseason is better for some needs than others.Last year's quarterback class, for instance, ended up being a good one -- not just through free agency (Sam Darnold just won the Super Bowl) but also through the draft (Cam Ward, Tyler Shough and Jaxson Dart all look like hits). This year's quarterback class? Not so much.With the combine fast approaching, we'll hear about which draft prospects are rising and which free agents will actually become available. As such, I took a look at this NFL offseason's group of available players through the lens of positional need. It's an obviously poor year to need a quarterback, but what about wide receiver? Tight end? Defensive tackle? Guard?Here are my rankings for the strongest and weakest positions for this offseason, weighing both free agency and the draft.Jump to: QB | RB | WR | TE | OT | IOL Edge | DT | LB | CB | S1. Edge rusherGood year to need ... any sort of edge rusher at all Bad year to need ... a truly elite dude (unless you'd like to send two first-rounders for Maxx Crosby)If your favorite team's general manager can't find a good fit at edge rusher this offseason, tell him to take a hike. Putting aside the Crosby trade rumors for now, here's a list of expected free agent edge rushers: Trey Hendrickson (Bengals), Odafe Oweh (Chargers), Jaelan Phillips (Eagles), Khalil Mack (Chargers), K'Lavon Chaisson (Patriots), Boye Mafe (Seahawks), Joey Bosa (Bills) and Jadeveon Clowney (Cowboys).The main thing that impresses me is the variety. Oweh, Chaisson and Mafe are speed artists who can create pressure fast. Guys such as Mack, Clowney and Kingsley Enagbare (Packers) are all hitters in the running game. Want to gamble on injured, aging veterans? Hendrickson, Bosa, Cameron Jordan (Saints) and Von Miller (Commanders) could all have something left. What about undeveloped traits? Kwity Paye (Colts) and Arnold Ebiketie (Falcons) are your guys. There's something for everyone in this group.Hendrickson, Oweh and Phillips can all reasonably be projected for 10-plus sacks next season, while Mafe, Chaisson, Mack and Bosa can all be eight-sack players. And that's without any surprises from more middle-tier veterans like Dre'Mont Jones (Ravens) and Al-Quadin Muhammad (Lions).In the draft, I think it's fair to have eight-plus-sack projections in mind for David Bailey (Texas Tech) and Rueben Bain Jr. (Miami). Bain is a tricky one. Apparently some teams view him as an undersized 3-tech instead of a big base end, but I've watched him win too many outside rushes too quickly to knock him inside just yet. The real wild card is Ohio State's Arvell Reese, an on-ball/off-ball linebacker hybrid whom the league reportedly prefers as an edge rusher. He has a chance to be a high-value player as a movement piece, but those guys don't tend to hit in Year 1.Is it time for Maxx Crosby and Raiders to part ways?Dan Graziano, Bart Scott and Mike Tannenbaum discuss the best course of action for Maxx Crosby and the Las Vegas Raiders in the offseason.All three of those prospects are top-10 pick candidates. We haven't even gotten to the bulk of the first round, where options abound.Auburn's Keldric Faulk was miscast in the Tigers' defense and will benefit from more true edge rusher snaps in the NFL -- he's this year's Mykel Williams, and Williams ended up going 11th. Cashius Howell (Texas A&M) is the Will Campbell of this class (albeit on defense), as his short arm length measurements will end up a limiting factor for many teams. But 11.5 sacks in his final season of highly explosive pass rushing should get him drafted early. And Akheem Mesidor (Miami) is the Tyler Shough of this class. He was highly productive late in his college career ... and I do mean late! He'll be 25 by draft night, and he is older than current NFLers Will Anderson Jr. and Lukas Van Ness. But man, that film is good.Expect to see at least six edges go in the first round (if we're counting Reese). Seven made it in Field Yates' most recent mock draft, as Missouri's Zion Young joined the party. While there isn't a truly elite rusher like Anderson or Abdul Carter, there are a ton of top-50 options, and some splashy free agents to boot.2. Interior offensive lineGood year to need ... a guard Bad year to need ... a really big centerInterior offensive line is always a spot at which teams can plug guys quite freely, but this feels like a uniquely good year for it. Tyler Linderbaum (Ravens) might actually become available, which would be surprising and likely record-setting. Drew Dalman became the third-highest paid center last year when he left Atlanta to join the Bears at $14 million per year; Linderbaum will likely leapfrog Creed Humphrey at the top of the center rankings ($18 million per year) and should push $19 million.Again, though ... if he becomes available. He's the blow-your-socks-off free agent, but after him, the interior is still deep. Guards Isaac Seumalo (Steelers) and David Edwards (Bills) were two of the best players at their position last season, and both are expected to become available. Alijah Vera-Tucker (Jets) has been one of the best young guards over the past few years, but he's coming off a torn triceps that complicates his 2026 projection even further. He has always struggled to play full seasons. If Joel Bitonio (34 years old) doesn't retire now that his contract is up with the Browns, he's still a plus starter. And if Ed Ingram has finally seen the light bulb go on -- as his end-of-season performance with the Texans seemed to indicate -- he's a plus starter, too.Center is a little thinner if Linderbaum stays in Baltimore, but Connor McGovern (Bills) and Cade Mays (Panthers) should both push for deals north of $8 million per year, which is top-10 money for the position. Center can be tough to suss out, and both played within excellent offensive lines as a whole. But McGovern, in particular, has been an impact player in Buffalo.Editor's PicksLooking for QB answers this NFL offseason? Good luck ... it's a bad year to need a new signal-callerBen Solak50 top free agents, 50 perfect NFL team fits: We picked where each player should sign in MarchMatt BowenFaces who need new places: We picked 32 players who could use fresh starts with new teamsAaron SchatzWhat center lacks for free agents it makes up for in the draft. While there's no Linderbaum likely to go Round 1, there is a ton of experience and NFL readiness. Jake Slaughter (Florida) and Connor Lew (Auburn) were both three-year starters in the SEC; Logan Jones (Iowa) was a four-year starter at Iowa. All three are smaller players who won't fit for every offense, but Sam Hecht (Kansas State) has the size those teams are seeking.Guard is splashier. One of the earliest picks in the draft will be Miami's Francis Mauigoa, who might get drafted as a tackle, but I'd wager he gets valued more at guard given his frame and play style. Either way, he's a top-five pick. Olaivavega Ioane (Penn State) is the other interior player who should hear his name called on Day 1 after Mauigoa, while Emmanuel Pregnon (Oregon) and Chase Bisontis (Texas A&M) have the exciting physical tool kits that get teams excited in Round 2 -- think Steve Avila or Dylan Fairchild. Potential kicks inside for college tackles Kadyn Proctor (Alabama) and Brian Parker II (Duke) would only strengthen the group.The free agent class is solid. The draft class is solid. Good year to need an interior offensive lineman.3. CornerbackGood year to need ... a slot corner Bad year to need ... an outside corner with sizeGreat players don't really hit free agency at cornerback, as the position has been in desperate need of the market-setting contracts it finally got when Pat Surtain II, Derek Stingley Jr., Jaycee Horn and Sauce Gardner all signed their extensions. Last year's group was actually a fairly competitive bunch: Byron Murphy Jr. didn't get out of Minnesota, but Charvarius Ward, Carlton Davis III, Paulson Adebo and D.J. Reed all signed deals with new teams.This year's group isn't as good. The outside-only guys are Riq Woolen (Seahawks), Jaylen Watson (Chiefs) and Jamel Dean (Buccaneers). Alontae Taylor (Saints) has inside-outside versatility, but he has always played his best ball from the slot. Similarly, Greg Newsome II played outside for the Jaguars but could return to some slot play with a new squad. (He was always more productive there.) One of the wild cards of this group is ex-Steeler Asante Samuel Jr., now more than a season removed from his spinal surgery. He is another inside-outside guy with a history of solid play.Woolen is a particularly tricky one to calibrate. He fell out of favor with Mike Macdonald's defensive staff multiple times in the past two seasons, getting benched for stretches. Yet he also led all cornerbacks in yards per coverage snap allowed (0.6) last season. In a simpler defense that lets Woolen play faster and think less, he might see more consistent and productive play (looking at you, Robert Saleh and the Titans).Get ready for the NFL offseason• Every team's offseason guide | Schedule • Top free agents | Best draft prospects • 11 trade proposals | 32 big questions • QB market | Overhaul tiers | Draft order • Coach hirings | Franchise tag candidates The draft class looks strong for cornerback overall, but even the best players are lacking in size. LSU's Mansoor Delane and Tennessee's Jermod McCoy -- both considered clear Round 1 players -- are both listed at 6-foot and sub-195 pounds. (And McCoy didn't play at all in 2025 after sustaining an ACL tear that January.) Clemson's Avieon Terrell, the younger brother of Falcons CB A.J. Terrell Jr. and another potential first-rounder, is a nickel at 5-11, 180 pounds. Even Keionte Scott (Miami) and D'Angelo Ponds (Indiana), the darlings of the College Football Playoff, are both clearly slot players at the next level.Defenses that need a starter on the outside, especially in a defense that prioritizes height and length, won't enjoy this offseason much should they miss out on Woolen or Watson. The draft target for size is Florida's Devin Moore, though he has a spotty injury history. Those defenses that prioritize interchangeability and quickness over size and stopping power -- like the Jeff Hafley unit in Green Bay and the Chris Shula group with the Rams -- will find plenty of options available.4. Running backGood year to need ... a starting back for right now Bad year to need ... a young back to start for the next four yearsThe running back class is all free agency this year ... and what a class it is. The headliners are Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker III and Breece Hall, seemingly the lone Jet not to get dealt at the deadline. Travis Etienne Jr. (Jaguars) and Javonte Williams (Cowboys) represent the second tier of options. Tyler Allgeier (Falcons), Rico Dowdle (Panthers) and Kenneth Gainwell (Steelers) all fill out the very respectable third tier. After all, Allgeier and Dowdle have been 1,000-yard rushers, and Gainwell would have been a 1,000-yard receiver this season if Aaron Rodgers had his druthers!Of those seven backs, all save for Gainwell could reasonably be the RB1A on a team in 2026. (Gainwell is just too small.) Dowdle and Allgeier are particularly fascinating options to me. Allgeier is a bruiser who has benefited from relieving Bijan Robinson, but we've seen him produce at a higher volume (210 carries for 1,035 yards in his rookie season). No, his top speed isn't particularly fearsome, but for an offense looking to just grind out positive yardage to support a high-flying passing attack (hello, Chiefs), he's a great target. Dowdle had a weird stretch of taking over the Panthers' lead back role, then losing control of it over the course of this season. But over the past two seasons, he's ninth among all backs in rushing success rate and 13th in rush yards over expectation.While the top of this free agent class won't measure up to 2024, when Josh Jacobs, Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry all changed teams, I do think that Walker and Hall are legit needle-movers. Walker had the third-highest explosive run rate of all RBs this season, and his lightning-strike running style saved the Seahawks offense down the back half of the season. Does he get out of Seattle after that dominant postseason run? I'm not sure. But Hall is destined to escape New York, where bad quarterback play has derailed his rookie-season promise. It's easy to forget, but this guy had 76 catches in 2023 and another 57 in 2024. He's a sleeping dual-threat giant.Will Kenneth Walker III still be with the Seahawks next season?The \"Get Up\" crew debates whether the Seahawks should do all they can to keep Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker III.The team that misses out on a solid free agent running back better hope it is drafting in the top 10, because Jeremiyah Love (Notre Dame) isn't just the crowning jewel of this running back class -- he's the only top-tier option. The RB2 in the 2026 draft might end up being Love's teammate at Notre Dame, Jadarian Price, who could emerge into a high-volume runner out of Love's shadow. Price is crafty and smooth, but he lacks the contact balance and breakaway speed that made Love the Irish's runner of choice.In addition to Price, there are enough RBs available that we'll see several leave the board on Day 2 and into early Day 3. Nicholas Singleton (Penn State) is a personal favorite, but he broke his foot at the Senior Bowl. Jonah Coleman (Washington) has juice, but he is undersized at 5-foot-9 and 228 pounds. Mike Washington Jr. (Arkansas) is dense and physical and dangerous in the open field, but he has fumbling issues. This is the thing with this running back class -- everyone has a big limiting factor.I'm sure a few Day 2 picks will hit. But in general, this is an offseason to solve your running back problems in March, not April.5. SafetyGood year to need ... a deep safety Bad year to need ... a box safetyIf you are looking for the next Nick Emmanwori, who was of course, the next Kyle Hamilton ... look elsewhere. Maybe stop looking altogether. The thing about unicorns is there's only one (or two) of them, and efforts to replicate them too often involve pinning toy horns on unknowing horses.There are a couple of big safeties in the draft and free agent classes that might, at first brush, look like potential hybrid linebackers like Emmanwori and Hamilton. Toledo's Emmanuel McNeil-Warren is 6-foot-2 and over 200 pounds, and Kansas City's Bryan Cook (a highly underrated player in the market right now) is 6-foot-1, 206 pounds in his own right. But both are better as deep coverage players than box players, with range and hitting power over edge-setting strength.The overall strength of this safety class is in its deep players. That's where Jaylinn Hawkins spent almost all of his time on a one-year deal with the Patriots, and he has played himself into a solid second contract. It's where Reed Blankenship has primarily been with the Eagles; he's due for a middle-tier veteran contract as an average starter. It's where Coby Bryant, one of the unheralded contributors to the Seahawks' Super Bowl defense, has played in the past two seasons in Mike Macdonald's system. (Bryant even has a CB background from his days in college.) Kam Curl and Kevin Byard III are other options further down the list.Breaking news from Adam SchefterDownload the ESPN app and enable Adam Schefter's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first. Opt in by tapping the alerts bell in the top right corner. For more information, click here. While the class mostly has players who win from deep alignments, safety gets the fifth spot here because it's still deep overall (deep, as in there are a lot of them, not deep alignments). Teams in desperate need of a quality man coverage safety in the box will ring up Nick Cross, a longtime starter for the Colts who will see a competitive market. Teams that like to blitz their safeties will reach out to Chicago's Jaquan Brisker, a fine player who might fall too low on Chicago's laundry list of free agents to be successfully retained.The most linebacker-esque safety of any note might be the star of the 2026 draft class, Caleb Downs. Used with Budda Baker-esque aggressiveness by Matt Patricia last season in the Buckeyes' defense, Downs has the quickness, route recognition and instincts to have an absurd range of influence when playing in short zones, while still having the requisite mass and play strength to fit the run. He's a more traditional box safety with some nickel ability, a la Baker or Brian Branch. He reminds me of prime Malcolm Jenkins in that you want him as near the action as possible; he'll both make plays himself and make pre-snap calls that unlock other second-level players.I have two wild cards I'd want to look at if I were an enterprising general manager -- one in free agency, one in the draft. The veteran is Jalen Thompson. He has played over 4,900 snaps in the past five seasons for the Cardinals and just finished out his second contract, but he's only 27. (He turns 28 this summer.) Jonathan Gannon's three-safety defensive structure in Arizona was quite unique, and Thompson's role is difficult to map onto other teams. I think a more traditional deep safety job would benefit him well.The draft wild card is LSU's A.J. Haulcy, who weighs in somewhere near 220 pounds. With serious stopping power as a downhill hitter, he reminds me at times of current Steeler (and rising free agent) Kyle Dugger. Common refrain for the safeties, but here it is again: Haulcy played more from depth than you'd expect for a player of his mass, but he could be more of a traditional box safety at the NFL level for those teams looking to still live in a single-high world.Downs is the only true star across the free agent and draft classes, but don't be surprised when McNeil-Warren joins him in the first round -- and multiple other safeties (Oregon's Dillon Thieneman, Penn State's Zakee Wheatley, etc.) are right behind in Round 2.6. LinebackerGood year to need ... a difference-maker Bad year to need ... a difference-maker and not have a top-10 pickIt is a total rock star year at the linebacker position. Three huge names are entering the fray. Two are rookies from Ohio State: Sonny Styles and the previously mentioned Arvell Reese. One is a free agent out of Jacksonville: Devin Lloyd.I'll start with just a dash of cold water. Lloyd is probably not a top-five linebacker in football; I'd say he's more LB10 or LB12. But he's almost certainly about to get paid like it. Last year was an enormous offseason for linebacker contracts, as four of the six biggest deals currently in the market were signed by Fred Warner, Zack Baun, Jamien Sherwood and Nick Bolton -- and Lloyd comfortably outperformed the latter two last season. I'd argue he outplayed Baun, as well. Lloyd is going to clear $15 million per year, and at that price tag, I'd likely pass if I was a general manager. With that said, Lloyd is still an impactful player. He's great on blitzes and made a huge step forward in coverage last season.What to know for NFL free agency• Ranking the top 50 players available • Every team's biggest decision | Best fits • Franchise tag candidates | Read more Styles is one of the best linebacker prospects of recent memory. He's 6-foot-4 and 240 pounds, rangy with great acceleration and deceleration, smart in play recognition against both the run and the pass, good at slipping blocks and reading a quarterback's eyes, reliable as a tackler and thunderous into contact. He's all that and a bag of chips. Styles is the first linebacker prospect I've seen since Roquan Smith in 2018 who makes me think, \"Oh, this dude can change the face of a defense.\"And Styles might not have even been the best linebacker on his own team! Reese, his running mate, was a hybrid player for the Buckeyes. Reese spent 33% of his snaps at linebacker last season and 67% as an edge defender. For my money, the film is better at off-ball linebacker. His range is unbelievable. His explosiveness into contact is play-wrecking. His feel in coverage isn't perfect, but for how excellent he is as a pass rusher, he shouldn't be dropping into coverage anyway. There's no reason a team that likes to blitz their 'backers and use mugged fronts on pass-rush downs shouldn't draft Reese as a turbocharged Lloyd or Kaden Elliss.Reese and Styles should both be top-six picks. Reese almost certainly will be, though the acquiring team might move him to edge rusher (lame, but I get it because of positional value). Styles might fall out of that range, but I think that would be an error.OK, so those are the three stars. Teams need either $16 million per year or a top-10 pick to go get them. After that ... man, I don't know.The middle tier of free agent linebackers isn't totally empty. The aforementioned Elliss is available for blitz-heavy teams, and Eagles starter Nakobe Dean is a quality player for those general managers who don't mind undersized linebackers (and those who miss some games). Packers starter Quay Walker enjoyed a breakout in 2024 under the same coach (Anthony Campanile) who authored Lloyd's emergence in 2025, and there's more to uncover in that physical profile. For those in the market of Band-Aid options, Alex Anzalone, Alex Singleton, Demario Davis, Lavonte David and Matt Milano are all viable veterans.In the draft class, the linebacker depth is predictably paltry. More and more undersized 'backers with no chance against the run trickle into the league every year. Texas' Anthony Hill Jr. makes it work despite his lack of size, playing at the sort of hyperspeed necessary to survive at the NFL level. Georgia's CJ Allen -- like all Bulldog defenders -- has more toughness and play strength than his measurables would indicate, but because he's so rocked up, his transitional quickness and flexibility suffer. The quality of linebacking in this draft class falls off a little less quickly than the free agent group, but it falls off just the same.Linebacker tends to be a developmental position in the NFL, so a few of these guys will hit as the years go on. But this is really an all-or-nothing positional group this offseason.7. Offensive tackleGood year to need ... a starter for 2027 Bad year to need ... a starter for 2026I really, really struggled with ranking offensive tackle. Here's why.There are about 4 billion names at the position in the draft this year. Guys I've seen get late-Round 1/early-Round 2/future developmental starter buzz include Arizona State's Max Iheanachor, Clemson's Blake Miller, Georgia's Monroe Freeling, Utah's Caleb Lomu, Alabama's Kadyn Proctor, Oregon's Isaiah World, Iowa's Gennings Dunker and Northwestern's Caleb Tiernan. Seemingly every draft we get a mini-run on developmental tackles in Round 3, but given how poor the class is overall this year, that run might come in Round 2.What to know for the 2026 NFL draft• Mocks: Kiper | Miller | Reid | Yates • Rankings: Kiper | Miller | Reid | Yates • Best by position | Draft order | More To be clear: I like plenty of these guys (Iheanachor and Miller are my dudes), and even the ones I'm sketchy on, I can see how a positive developmental track would play out. But even for those guys I like, the idea of a Week 1 start really shakes me up. Forcing young tackles into action too soon can teach them bad habits and hurt their confidence.The best immediate starters by consensus are Francis Mauigoa (Miami) and Spencer Fano (Utah). But Mauigoa looks like a guard to me, and Fano is far too skinny for my tastes at tackle. I don't view either as a set-it-and-forget-it pass protector in Year 1, the way I felt about Joe Alt or Charles Cross coming out.Of course, the whole point of the draft is acquiring developmental youth, and the whole point of free agency is acquiring immediate (if unspectacular) starters. There are two enticing names available to that end. The first is Rasheed Walker, a 26-year-old three-year starter with excellent pass-blocking film out of Green Bay. How is a guy like this escaping his current team? Well, the run blocking leaves a lot to be desired. Walker is a fit for teams that want to live in the gun and drop back plenty, but balanced attacks will worry about hiding him in the running game.The second name is Braden Smith, who bounced back nicely in 2025 after a fraught 2024. Smith's up-and-down play and lack of length (32¼-inch arms) will similarly limit the teams for which he is a fit -- he's simply not a plug-and-play starter, which is what is expected at the top of the free agent market. And these are the only two names, really. No other offensive tackle made ESPN's top 50 free agent list from Matt Bowen.Thus my difficulty in ranking this tackle class. I'm confident that sharp teams that know their coaching staff's predilections will find the apple of their eye in this loaded group, but there are plenty of pitfalls to be avoided along the way. Is Jermaine Eluemunor's career turnaround at 31 years old legitimate and worth a solid veteran deal? Can Braxton Jones find some career stability outside of Chicago, where injuries and coaching staff changes have stunted his development?8. Wide receiverGood year to need ... bodies in the bullpen Bad year to need ... the next elite guyWide receiver is an impossible position to rank, too. There's really no such thing as a bad receiver class. There are too many body types that work at the position, and too many ways to funnel production to players across the board, that even the bad classes might have a few stars in it. I remember when we called the 2023 wide receiver draft class bad. The first wide receiver off the board was at No. 20. What was his name again? That's right ... Jaxon Smith-Njigba. (Puka Nacua was also in the 2023 class, I just don't have a cheeky bit for him.)With that necessary caveat in place, it does not feel like a good year for elite receivers. Top receivers rarely make free agency anymore, as the blue-chip players at the position are too valuable to let anywhere near the open market. The Cowboys will reportedly franchise-tag George Pickens accordingly, per ESPN's Adam Schefter. Were Pickens to make it in this class, he'd be given a contract near $35 million per year.Riddick: Mike Evans will be in high demandLouis Riddick and Booger McFarland react to Mike Evans playing in 2026 and being set to be a free agent.As it is, the top of the free agent class features Alec Pierce (Indianapolis), Romeo Doubs (Green Bay) and Jauan Jennings (San Francisco). Pierce is the buzzy name after a breakout 2025 season in which he led all receivers in yards per target (11.9) and was second to Tyquan Thornton in yards per reception (21.3). Pierce's average target was 18.8 yards downfield -- again, second only to Thornton -- as Indianapolis used his excellent combination of height, speed and ball tracking on schemed shot plays and one-on-one alerts alike.Pierce's beauty isn't just in one big season, but in the dirty work he did before he broke out. His 2024 was already a great season for big play creation (12.1 yards per target, better than his 2025 number), but in 2023 and 2022, he ground his nose as a blocker and has more \"big slot\" potential than the Colts film indicates. He's the one I could see becoming a three-level receiver with high-volume usage ... something like Mike Evans, if we're really shooting for the stars.But otherwise, it's strong WR2s and WR3s. Doubs is an every-down player with good route running but unreliable hands. Jennings is a high-impact blocker who can be a high-volume player in spots but should more so be a third-option stick mover. The aforementioned Evans lacks the juice to separate that he once had but still wins with physicality for those quarterbacks who like throwing back-shoulder balls on the outside. Rashid Shaheed, Deebo Samuel, Wan'Dale Robinson and Christian Kirk can all still fill roles behind star receivers.One wild card to watch is a household name: Tyreek Hill. For as much as I'd like to believe Hill can recover his 2023 and 2024 form, he'll never again play in a fresh Mike McDaniel offense taking the league by storm. He's coming off a dislocated knee with multiple ligament tears. I cannot reasonably weigh him in this free agent class, but with a heroic recovery, he'll be an impactful signing in 2026.Another wild-card name is the Vikings' Jalen Nailor. Of course, he's not nearly as buzzy, but Nailor has been an effective speed option on play-action shots and YAC throws behind Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison in Minnesota, and I wouldn't be surprised if he blossoms into a valuable field stretcher for his next team. Teams that miss out on Shaheed should hustle to secure Nailor's services.Onto the draft class. There will be some early-drafted receivers this year. Ohio State's Carnell Tate and Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson are the two big prospects, with Makai Lemon (USC) also sneaking into the conversation for teams looking to fill their slot role. But I don't rank any of these players above Tetairoa McMillan from last season, or Marvin Harrison Jr., Malik Nabers, Rome Odunze and Brian Thomas Jr. from 2024. Tate and Tyson, should they go top 10, will benefit from a poor draft class pushing them up into higher draft capital.The names on Day 2 are thinner than usual. Indiana's Omar Cooper Jr. is my preferred Round 2 target, assuming Washington's Denzel Boston has already left the board on late Day 1. Chris Bell (Louisville) is the big injury risk this season, as a torn ACL ended his emphatic 2025 season early. Zachariah Branch (Georgia) is the guy everyone will fall in love with for his 10 best plays, despite being perilously undersized (5-10, 175 pounds) for NFL play.By no means is this a receiver class without options. The trade market might expand on those options and strengthen the class accordingly, if A.J. Brown gets dealt out of Philadelphia, or if Brandon Aiyuk is healthy and ready to play after escaping San Francisco. Neither feels like a sure thing, yet both are exciting possibilities. That's the story of every wide receiver class, of course -- there are just so many players at this position, year over year. Relative to past groups, though, this year's offerings don't stack up.9. Tight endGood year to need ... undersized tight ends Bad year to need ... any significant blocking abilityIf tight ends were legally not permitted to weigh above 250 pounds, this would be an unbelievable year to get one. Oregon's Kenyon Sadiq, likely the lone first-rounder at the position, has loose movement traits and explosive downfield strides to boot. Of course, his 6-3, 245-pound frame is real small -- we're talking Evan Engram, Sam LaPorta or Chig Okonkwo size. And would you look at that ... Okonkwo is in this free agent class.New ESPN and NFL+ Premium BundleBundle ESPN and NFL+ Premium and unlock more NFL content at a great price. Get all of ESPN's Monday Night Football, NFL Primetime and more. Sign Up Now If you like your 240 pounds a little more stretched out, I have good news for you. Kyle Pitts Sr., the famously supersized wide receiver at 6-5 and 245 pounds, is the gem of this free agent group. Pitts has improved as a blocker over his five years in Atlanta, going from unplayable to passable, but it's really his involvement as a three-level, high-volume receiver this past year that will get him paid.Pitts fits both with offenses looking for an explosive play-action element from a downfield tight end (think prime Darren Waller or current Dalton Kincaid) and offenses looking to spread their tight end out and pepper him as an every-down receiver (think prime Travis Kelce or Zach Ertz). Pitts looks to be back to his prime athletic self as he gets another year removed from his 2022 knee injury, and I think he'll surprise folks with how much he signs for and how well he produces.Kelce is also technically in this class, though the idea of him doing anything other than playing for the Chiefs or retiring is laughable. More meaningfully, Baltimore's Isaiah Likely (another WR masquerading as a TE) will be looking for a TE1 job out of Mark Andrews' shadow, and Cleveland's David Njoku still has some juice both as a receiver and as a blocker. But again, two players under 250 pounds.The issue for these undersized tight ends? So long as the lighter, pass-catching tight ends are paying off their targets with highly efficient and explosive receiving performances, then they deservedly stay on the field. But if they can't either take on a huge volume of targets as a reliable stick mover (think Trey McBride) or create explosives in limited opportunities (think Colston Loveland), then they have to block well in order to play. Otherwise, it would be better to just field a receiver who might also impact only a little as a blocker but at least has more overall juice in terms of speed and quickness.Jobs are much safer for the plodding 260-pounders who will never break the bank but will always have a role for their in-line blocking. Those guys are simply not available this year. Check your math if you think Cade Otton (Buccaneers) or Dallas Goedert (Eagles) fits the bill. Otton lined up in the slot or out wide just as often as Pitts this past season, and Goedert's best days as a blocker are well behind him. Charlie Kolar (Ravens) is the sneaky target here as teams look for pile movers, though Baltimore wants to keep him in-house.The consensus on the draft class behind Sadiq is all over the place. Vanderbilt's Eli Stowers and Ohio State's Max Klare are both in the running for TE2, but they have the same concerns for size and blocking ceiling that the rest of the field does. Cincinnati's Joe Royer is perhaps the most exciting player for blocking floor and ceiling, while still having a viable path to receiving impact. Georgia's Oscar Delp is another middle-round name to watch. And Stanford's Sam Roush is the Jackson Hawes of this class -- all block, sometimes rock.10. Defensive tackleGood year to need ... John Franklin-Myers Bad year to need ... an impactful defensive tackle on third downWeird, weird, weird year when there are simply no interior defensive linemen to go around. This is a position that has been better and better appreciated by league analysts and fans alike in recent years -- not to mention by owners' wallets. After Milton Williams signed a four-year, $104 million contract in free agency last season on the back of one year of productive rotational play, the message couldn't be ignored: If a front office has the chance to get a field-tipping player at this position, it should do it.Check out 'NFL Draft Daily' on ESPN2Want to know more about the 2026 NFL draft class? ESPN's new show 'NFL Draft Daily' airs Monday-Friday at 3 p.m. ET on ESPN2, ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. Join Mel Kiper Jr., Field Yates and other experts for the latest on top prospects. Well, there aren't any this year. One -- just one! -- defensive tackle made Bowen's top 50 free agent list this cycle. Broncos veteran Franklin-Myers is an extremely likable player with inside-outside versatility, a powerful bull rush and a three-down skill set. But he'll turn 30 next season, and the Broncos already told us what they thought of Franklin-Myers when they extended fellow defensive tackle Malcolm Roach in November -- months after re-signing another defensive tackle D.J. Jones -- to run next to Zach Allen. Franklin-Myers was low on their priority list.I expect Franklin-Myers to get a solid contract because somebody has to get one. Aging veterans Calais Campbell (Cardinals), David Onyemata (Falcons) and Sheldon Rankins (Texans) should see decent one-year deals for their service. Khyiris Tonga (Patriots) signed a one-year, $2.1 million deal in one of the bargains of free agency last year, and he joins such players as Sebastian Joseph-Day (Titans) and DJ Reader (Lions) as viable nose tackles who will, again, see solid short-team deals.Can the draft class save the defensive tackle-needy teams? Not really! There is no sure thing along the defensive interior in the 2026 draft class. For those teams already secure with their 2026 starters, there are some high-upside swings, though. Peter Woods (Clemson) entered the 2025 season as one of the top draft prospects overall, and while his stock fell some following a down year, the potential is still clearly there for a game-wrecking 3-technique. Caleb Banks (Florida) looked to build on a strong 2024, but he lost all but three games in the 2025 season to a foot injury.Both will likely go Round 1 not just because the class is generally poor, but because defensive tackle is such a premium position and many teams will enter the draft with needs unanswered by free agency. Those who miss out on Woods and Banks will go after Texas Tech's Lee Hunter or Ohio State's Kayden McDonald, but both are true nose tackles who aren't ready to impact the pass rush often in Year 1.If forced to identify the sleepers I'd target in this group ... Tim Settle Jr. (Texans) always impresses in rotational play as a surprisingly quick penetrator for such a big, boxy build. And Domonique Orange (Iowa State) has the measurables and first step of a Jordan Davis-like space gobbler. He could provide just enough on pass-rush downs to warrant a solid second contract, at least after a few years of growth.11. QuarterbackGood year to need ... Fernando Mendoza Bad year to need ... anyone elseWhat do you want me to tell you? If I could earnestly include Mendoza in the pool of \"available quarterback options for QB-needy teams,\" maybe this position would leapfrog the interior defensive line. But Mendoza is all but off the board to the Raiders, leaving roughly a dozen other teams with serious quarterback needs in the lurch.The second-best quarterback prospect is Alabama's Ty Simpson. He's a one-year starter in college, he didn't have elite production in that one year, and he lacks top-flight tools (size, arm strength, speed). That's the long and the short of it.There's plenty of ways to talk yourself into him as a developmental player. He rose quickly in his lone season as a starter, bouncing back from a poor season opener and catching some fire through October and November. He can see the full field from the pocket and has the intangibles and coachability of a player who will succeed in the pros. But again, this is a developmental player -- a year away from seeing the field. He should be drafted where Jalen Milroe (who started above him at Alabama in 2024) was drafted -- the mid-third round. Maybe Simpson goes higher because his play style is more typically pro-ready, but we're talking ourselves into a second-round pick on projection here.Tim Hasselbeck: Malik Willis will 'walk in as the anointed starter somewhere'Tim Hasselbeck and Mina Kimes explain why they can see a strong free agent market for Malik Willis.Yet Simpson may go to the Rams at No. 29 because they have the extra first-round pick and need developmental youth at quarterback. If they pass on Simpson, who is there? Garrett Nussmeier (LSU) had the film in 2024 to push for Round 1, but he wasn't 100% in 2025 and lacks ideal NFL size; he's now likely a Day 3 pick. And Carson Beck (Miami) and Drew Allar (Penn State) and Cade Klubnik (Clemson) are all trading on recruiting rankings.The free agent and trade markets have more viable options than the draft class, but that isn't saying much. Malik Willis is an exciting free agent in that he's an enormous mystery box, and the few peeks we've gotten beneath the wrapping paper have looked marvelous. Among quarterbacks with at least 100 dropbacks over the past two seasons, Willis is first in QBR, yards per dropback, completion percentage and explosive pass rate. But again, that's on 115 dropbacks collected over a few relief appearances and three measly starts.Willis is far from a sure thing -- even less sure than Sam Darnold was when he got his three-year, $100.5 million deal from the Seahawks last offseason. A trade target like Tua Tagovailoa is a sure thing, but the surety is in his limitations. The Dolphins have shown over the past few seasons just how many offensive resources have to be dedicated to Tagovailoa's skill set to make his passing game viable. Teams that want a spot starter to run some spread RPO offenses should like Tagovailoa, but not with any designs on him becoming the next Baker Mayfield or Darnold reclamation.The better target for veteran reclamation is Kyler Murray, whom the Cardinals will almost certainly jettison via release if they cannot find a trade partner to take on his heavy contract. Murray is coming off a foot injury and has not looked the same outside of Kliff Kingsbury's offense. So while he has some of the signs of a veteran QB reclamation -- the high draft background, the physical talent, etc. -- he also has some warts that the veteran reclamations often don't bring. Murray will be 29 next season and simply might not be the sort of escape artist he once was. That's a hard portfolio to buy into.The only thing I like about this quarterback class (sans Mendoza) is how many rookie contract dart throws are floating around on various rosters. The list includes Anthony Richardson Sr., Will Levis, Spencer Rattler, Tanner McKee -- and even Milroe now that Darnold has proved he's the guy in Seattle. For the many teams that will be stuck with an uninspiring veteran this offseason, it isn't hard to find the desperate prayer of a young passer to pair with him.",

We came up with four potential offers for Eagles wide receiver A.J. Brown on Thursday, but another star has part of the trade conversation: Raiders edge rusher Maxx Crosby.New Las Vegas head coach Klint Kubiak and owner Mark Davis made it clear that they want Crosby to return, while Crosby has said any talk of wanting out of Las Vegas did not come from him. Still, what if Crosby was on available?We asked NFL analysts Jeremy Fowler, Dan Graziano, Ben Solak and Seth Walder to play general manager of four different teams and craft realistic trade offers for Crosby. Then we had Raiders reporter Ryan McFadden make a decision based on what general manager John Spytek and the team could do this offseason.Here's how our market simulation played out, starting with some background on Crosby's situation and ending with a verdict on a potential new landing spot.Jump to: Where things stand Four offers | The verdictThe latest on a potential Maxx Crosby tradeThis situation is pretty fluid. Crosby, who signed a three-year, $106.5 million extension last offseason, was upset the team shut him down during the final two weeks of the season because of a knee injury that required surgery in January. He has also been determined to win at the highest level, and the Raiders are starting a rebuild under first-time head coach Klint Kubiak.Editor's Picks\"Why not this staff?\": Klint Kubiak is choosing to overlook Raiders' past and embrace new opportunityRyan McFaddenOur simulated trade market for A.J. Brown: Which teams should be interested in the star WR?Jeremy Fowler, +4 MoreBarnwell plays NFL offseason trade negotiator: 11 swaps that make sense for both teamsBill BarnwellA trade could be beneficial for both sides. Crosby, 28, could get an opportunity to play for a true contender. Meanwhile, the Raiders would have a dead-cap hit of $5.1 million but save $30.69 million, according to OverTheCap.com. Las Vegas could also add draft capital to help build on its roster.Still, there's a strong argument in keeping Crosby. Edge rushers are a premium position and Crosby is continuously one of the best in the league. He earned his fifth Pro Bowl selection in 2025 after 10 sacks in 15 games. And we've seen teams turn things around in one season. The Patriots, for example, appeared in Super Bowl LX despite finishing 4-13 in 2024.Las Vegas has the second-most cap space in the league (per Roster Management System) and is expected to have eight draft picks, including the first overall pick. If the Raiders play their cards right, they could field a competitive roster sooner rather than later. Las Vegas also promoted defensive line coach Rob Leonard, who works directly with Crosby, to defensive coordinator. -- Ryan McFadden, Raiders reporterFour hypothetical trade offers for CrosbyChicago BearsJeremy Fowler's offer:Raiders get: WR DJ Moore, 2026 first-round pick (No. 25 overall), 2027 third-round pickBears get: CrosbyWhy this deal makes sense: Like Bill Barnwell's suggested proposal from Monday, I have Moore involved in this Crosby trade with Chicago. The Bears must upgrade a defensive line that tied with the Bengals for last in pass rush win rate last season (28.8%). The presence of Crosby would elevate a team on the cusp of being a contender after reaching the divisional round in coach Ben Johnson's first year with the team.Moore's departure would allow Chicago to center its future passing game around Rome Odunze, Colston Loveland and Luther Burden III. They would also save $16.5 million on the cap, helping absorb Crosby's three-year, $106.5 million deal. For Las Vegas, it gets an alpha receiver for projected No. 1 pick Fernando Mendoza and additional draft capital to improve other units.Dallas CowboysDan Graziano's offer: Raiders get: WR George Pickens, 2026 first-round pick (No. 20 overall)Cowboys get: Crosby, 2026 second-round pick (No. 36 overall)Why this deal makes sense: The Cowboys likely aren't going to fork over a long-term, top-of-market deal for Pickens, and franchise-tagging him could cause more problems than it solves (as it did last year with edge rusher Micah Parsons). They get back Crosby, who will make around $30 million per year for the next two years and would replace Parsons. Then, Dallas could look elsewhere for its No. 2 wide receiver.The Raiders would have to sign Pickens long-term, but they're not already paying CeeDee Lamb top-three WR money, as the Cowboys are. Pickens fits better into Las Vegas' budget than he does into Dallas' roster.Fowler: The Cowboys-Pickens situation could get messyJeremy Fowler, Damien Woody and Tim Hasselbeck discuss the future of George Pickens with the Dallas Cowboys.Tampa Bay BuccaneersBen Solak's offer:Raiders get: WR Chris Godwin Jr., 2026 first-round pick (No. 15 overall), 2027 second-round pickBuccaneers get: Crosby, 2027 fifth-round pickWhy this deal makes sense: Raiders general manager John Spytek worked under Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht for years in Tampa Bay, so he would likely value Godwin more than most other teams. Godwin would be a target sponge in Las Vegas and give Kubiak a quality blocking receiver. Godwin and a first-round pick, along with some more finagling in the middle rounds, should get the deal done.Crosby would solve the edge-rushing problem Tampa Bay has been unable to fix for years. The Bucs haven't had a player reach 10 sacks in a single season since Shaquil Barrett in 2021; Crosby has done it in each of the past four seasons.Los Angeles ChargersSeth Walder's offer: Raiders get: 2026 second-round pick (No. 55 overall), 2026 sixth-round pick, 2027 fifth-round pickChargers get: CrosbyWhy this deal makes sense: Let me start with the Raiders, who would surely bristle at the notion of trading their star within their division. But that fear is short-sighted: If you are going to trade away a star, why not take draft capital from a rival? By the time the Raiders are true contenders again, Crosby might well be slowing down while the draft picks have four cost-controlled years to play for Las Vegas -- and against the Chargers.The Chargers, with Chris O'Leary replacing Jesse Minter at defensive coordinator, could use help at edge rusher. Khalil Mack and Odafe Oweh are pending free agents, so the Chargers could use their bounty of cap space to trade for and absorb Crosby's contract. The fact that Crosby's deal is salary heavy (meaning the Chargers take on the money) and that he will turn 29 before next season, is why I'm not offering a first-round pick here.Get ready for the NFL offseason• Every team's offseason guide | Schedule • Top free agents | Best draft prospects • 11 trade proposals | 32 big questions • QB market | Overhaul tiers | Draft order • Coach hirings | Franchise tag candidates The verdict: Cowboys' offer gives Raiders a WR1Fowler's offer (Bears) and Solak's offer (Buccaneers) are compelling since they include wide receivers, which Walder's proposal from the Chargers does not include. But Graziano's offer from the Cowboys would give the Raiders a top wide receiver, assuming they lock down Pickens on a long-term deal.Pickens turns 25 on March 4 and is coming off a career-high nine touchdowns and 1,429 receiving yards in 2025. The Raiders haven't had a player reach that receiving mark since Davante Adams in 2022. By pairing Pickens with running back Ashton Jeanty, tight end Brock Bowers and wide receiver Tre Tucker, Mendoza could have a strong supporting cast around him in Year 1.On top of that, they would have an extra pick at No. 20 to address needs on the defensive or offensive lines. The Raiders were 15th in run stop win rate and 17th in pass rush win rate last season; they were 22nd in both run block win rate and pass block win rate. -- McFadden",

(AP) — The Chicago Bears have promoted pass game coordinator Press Taylor to offensive coordinator to replace the departed Declan Doyle, one of four coaching moves announced by the team on Wednesday.Taylor was Jacksonville’s offensive coordinator from 2022 to 2024. His promotion comes after Doyle left to call plays in Baltimore under new Ravens coach Jesse Minter.Coach Ben Johnson will continue to call plays after the Bears made the playoffs in his first season. Chicago’s offense ranked sixth overall, with quarterback Caleb Williams making big strides in his second year. The No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft, he threw for a franchise-record 3,942 yards with 27 touchdowns and seven interceptions.The Bears were third in rushing, with D’Andre Swift and rookie Kyle Monangai leading the way. Chicago also committed a league-low 11 turnovers. The Bears also hired Eric Studesville as running backs coach, Will Lawing as offensive analyst and Isaiah Ford as offensive quality control coach. A 29-year NFL coaching veteran, Studesville was a Bears assistant in the late 1990s and spent the past eight seasons in Miami, working alongside Johnson for part of that time. Studesville takes over for Eric Bieniemy, who left to become Kansas City’s offensive coordinator.

(AP) — Green Bay general manager Brian Gutekunst remains optimistic about the Packers’ long-term outlook as they head into the offseason after a gut-wrenching playoff loss to the Chicago Bears.But he acknowledges they must do a much better job of finishing games.Gutekunst spoke to reporters Wednesday for the first time since the Packers signed him as well as coach Matt LaFleur and executive vice president/director of football operations Russ Ball to multiyear contract extensions last week. The move by new Packers team president/CEO Ed Policy keeps the Packers’ football leadership triad intact despite a string of disappointing postseason defeats.“In every season, there’s successes, and there’s failures and there’s disappointments,” Gutekunst said. “I was proud of our team in a lot of areas this year, but finishing games is certainly something that we got to concentrate on as we head into 2026.” The Packers (9-8-1) dropped their final five games, including a 31-27 wild-card loss to the Bears in which they blew a 21-3 halftime lead and allowed 25 fourth-quarter points.Green Bay hasn’t reached the Super Bowl since the 2010 team — assembled by GM Ted Thompson, coached by Mike McCarthy and quarterbacked by four-time NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers — won it all.

The Packers had won four in a row at that point, but they watched No. 1 wide receiver Christian Watson leave the stadium in an ambulance after suffering a chest injury, then lost All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons to a torn ACL in his left knee later in the game. While Watson returned the following week, Parsons was lost for the season, just as the team had lost emerging star tight end Tucker Kraft to an ACL tear in his right knee in a Nov. 2 loss to the Carolina Panthers.“We were 9-3-1, and I didn’t think we had played particularly great football during the season. I thought we had moments, but I thought we had an opportunity to round into form there in the second half of the season,” Gutekunst said. “And obviously it didn’t work out that way.”And now, the Packers face a challenging offseason full of potential change. Not only did they lose defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, who left to become the Miami Dolphins head coach, but they have a number of starters and key contributors from their 2022 draft class set to hit free agency in March.Those players who could leave include left tackle Rasheed Walker, middle linebacker Quay Walker, center/guard Sean Rhyan and wide receiver Romeo Doubs. Prized backup quarterback Malik Willis, who played well in place of an injured Jordan Love, also is a free agent and could land a starting opportunity elsewhere. “We have one goal here, and we never run from it. We’re here to win championships,” Gutekunst said. “And I think this team is capable of that.“(The) 2026 (team) will be a different team, but the expectations won’t change. Again, I thought there’s some really good things during the (2025) season. There also were some major disappointments. But I really do like the guys we have in that locker room, the guys that are coming back, and we’ll continue to add to that. And we’re all excited to get at it.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

      "content": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) — The Chicago Bears thrilled the city in coach Ben Johnson’s first season. They pulled out one comeback win after another on their way to capturing the NFC North championship after finishing last in the division. They advanced in the playoffs for the first time in 15 years by rallying to beat Green Bay in a wild-card game before losing an overtime thriller to Matthew Stafford and the Los Angeles Rams in the divisional round.Now, it’s time to start building on everything they accomplished. Then again, maybe building isn’t the right word.“There is no building off of this,” Johnson said on Wednesday. “We go back to square one. We’re back at the bottom again. That’s really all 32 teams. If you feel otherwise, you’re probably missing the big picture.”The Bears are obviously starting from a stronger position, with Caleb Williams on his way to becoming a franchise quarterback after setting the team’s single-season passing record in his second year and Johnson looking like the coach to lead him to that next level. It’s a big change from last January, when the team was reeling after finishing 5-12 and firing former coach Matt Eberflus along the way. Now, for the first time since he was hired in 2022, general manager Ryan Poles heads into the offseason with a contender rather than a rebuilding project. Related Stories Mike LeFleur keeps 10 holdovers on Cardinals staff, including defensive coordinator Nick Rallis 1 MIN READ Harbaugh reshapes Chargers staff with 8 hires, including ex-Jets coach Adam Gase 1 MIN READ Browns tab Travis Switzer as OC, Mike Rutenberg as DC, and Byron Storer as special teams coordinator 3 MIN READ “You just have more constraints,” he said. “At the same time, I don’t think the process changes. You’re gonna identify the guys that fit what we want in our football team, which coach hit, and you just keep trying to acquire those players. We know what they look like, we know how they act, we know how they talk, and we’ll continue to do that.” Poles had a big offseason a year ago.He transformed a struggling offensive line by trading for guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson and signing center Drew Dalman. He also drafted Ozzy Trapilo in the second round. The Boston College product emerged as the starting left tackle, only to tear the patellar tendon in his left knee in the wild-card game against Green Bay. Poles didn’t have a specific timeline for his return, though he figures to be out long term after having surgery.“I’m sure it’ll be deep into next (season), with the injury,” Poles said. “So, we’ve had a conversation with him. He knows this is part of his journey that he has to overcome. I have a lot of faith in him and our staff to get him back ready to go whenever that is.”Trapilo was one of four major contributors drafted by Poles this past year.The Bears also hit big with tight end Colston Loveland in the first round, receiver Luther Burden in the second and running back Kyle Monangai in the seventh. Loveland, the No. 10 pick out of Michigan, led Chicago in receptions (58) and yards (713) and tied for the team lead in touchdown catches (six). The speedy and elusive Burden had 652 yards receiving. And the hard-running Monangai rushed for 783 yards as part of a productive tandem with D’Andre Swift.The Bears have some decisions to make at safety with All-Pro Kevin Byard and Jaquan Brisker set to become free agents. The 32-year-old Byard, who led the league with seven interceptions, said this week he’d like to return. And Poles would like to have him back. “I have no problem saying that’s a player that we would like to have back,” Poles said. “But, again, when you add the other safeties into that mix and all the other decisions we have across the roster, with cap restraints and things like that, it’ll be a challenge. But that’s part of what we do.”Poles also acknowledged a need to improve the line on a defense that ranked 29th overall and 27th against the run. Chicago tied for 22nd in sacks with 35. But the Bears appear to have the two most important pieces in place — the coach and the quarterback.“I’m really encouraged about the steps he took this year,” Johnson said. “I’m Caleb Williams’ No. 1 believer. I have a lot of faith in him and what he’s capable of doing and the player that he’s still striving to become.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

      "content": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) — There were all sorts of thoughts running through Caleb Williams’ mind as he drove home after the Chicago Bears’ gut-wrenching playoff exit.One thing that jarred him was the realization that instead of reviewing video on Monday, he and his teammates would be clearing out their lockers. Williams also felt a strong sense of gratitude in the wake of the Bears’ 20-17 overtime loss to the Los Angeles Rams in the divisional round on Sunday night.“To bring life, to bring joy, to bring excitement, to being a Chicago Bears fan, to be able to cheer for us,” Williams said Monday. “I do take pride in it. It’s really cool, honestly, to be able to have those small things like that. Just being able to have the city behind you. You lose that game, you’re walking out of the game and the fans stand up and cheer and roar in a tough moment. It goes a long way.” The Bears came a long way under first-year coach Ben Johnson. They went 11-6 and won their first NFC North title since 2018 after finishing last a year ago and advanced in the playoffs for the first time in 15 years. Along the way, they provided plenty of thrills.

And on Sunday, it looked like the Bears might have one more rally in them. Williams made an incredible touchdown throw in the closing seconds of regulation. But on his last pass of the game, a miscommunication with DJ Moore led to an interception. Matthew Stafford then drove the Rams into position for the winning field goal.Instead of preparing for a trip to Seattle for the NFC championship game, Chicago turns its attention toward the offseason. The Bears are in a far better place than they were a year ago. Williams looks to improve his accuracyWilliams made big strides in his second season and first in Johnson’s system, passing for a franchise-record 3,942 yards with 27 touchdowns and seven interceptions. His accuracy remains an issue, and that’s something he plans to address in the offseason.Williams completed 58.1% of his passes and ranked 24th among qualifying players. The only other quarterback below 60% was Tennessee’s Cam Ward at 59.8%.“Was I too far forward? Was I too far back?” Williams said. “Was I not consistent enough with my footwork and did I lean off and fall off the mound, is what we call it? Things like that.”Bears are set along the offensive lineThe Bears don’t have to worry about their offensive line this offseason. That’s a big change from recent years.General manager Ryan Poles rebuilt the interior of the line by trading for guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson and signing center Drew Dalman. He also drafted Ozzy Trapilo in the second round.Thuney, acquired from Kansas City, was first-team All-Pro for the third time. Dalman earned his first Pro Bowl selection. Jackson started every game, and Trapilo emerged as the starting left tackle during the season. With Darnell Wright, a second-team All-Pro, at right tackle, the Bears’ line was one of the league’s best. All five players are under contract for next year.“We just had exit interviews — like you talk to the coaches and you have a clear view of, here are my deficiencies, here’s what needs to get better and what do we need to do as a group better,” Dalman said. “And so I think when you have all those guys that experienced those mistakes together in the past, it makes it all the more like poignant next year when we’re trying to address them.”Improving defensive line could be a focusThe Bears could use some help up front on defense. They were prone to giving up long drives, and when it came to taking down the quarterback, they were near the bottom of the NFL. With 35 sacks, they finished in a five-way tie for 22nd place. Turnover at safety?Safeties Kevin Byard and Jaquan Brisker are on expiring contracts. The 32-yeard-old Byard said he “would love” to re-sign with the Bears, with his two-year contract set to expire following one of his best seasons. He earned his third first-team All-Pro selection while leading the NFL in interceptions for the second time in his career. He picked off seven passes, one shy of his career high with Tennessee in 2017.Byard said he wanted to prove he was still an elite player when he signed with Chicago after being released by Philadelphia. He played a huge role in the Bears leading the league in interceptions (23), takeaways (33) and turnover differential (plus-22).“I really enjoyed this season and I would love to be back,” he said.Brisker stayed healthy in his fourth season, playing a career-high 17 games after missing the final 12 in 2024 due to a concussion. He had a sack and two passes defensed against Los Angeles.Next stepsThe Bears are bullish on their future. They believe they have the right coach and quarterback, and they can now entice free agents to join a winner.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

Jim Breech’s 40-yard field goal, with 3:20 remaining gave Cincinnati a 16-13 lead.San Francisco started the winning drive at its 8-yard line, with quarterback Joe Montana (“Joe Cool”) famously scanning the crowd at the beginning of the march and telling his teammates, “Look, there’s John Candy.”Then Montana took apart Cincinnati’s defense. On the 11th play of the series, Montana hit John Taylor with a 10-yard pass over middle for the winning touchdown with 34 seconds remaining.At halftime, the score was 3-3, the first time in Super Bowl history the game was tied at intermission. Both teams exchanged field goals and Stanford Jennings’ 93-yard kickoff return gave the Bengals a 13-6 lead with 4 seconds remaining in the third quarter. The 49ers came back with an 85-yard drive in four plays, concluding with Montana’s 14-yard pass to Jerry Rice. Rice was voted the most valuable player after catching 11 passes for a record 215 yards. Montana completed 23 of 36 passes for a record 357 yards. ___Super Bowl XXIIJan. 31, 1988At San Diego_73,302Washington0350742Denver1000010The Washington Redskins, with the greatest quarter in NFL playoff history, scored 35 points in the second period to overcome a 10-0 deficit and win their second Super Bowl championship. John Elway threw a 56-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Nattiel on the Broncos’ first play from scrimmage and Rich Karlis kicked a 24-yard field goal on the next possession to take a 10-0 lead.The Redskins scored five touchdowns on consecutive possessions in the second quarter, four on passes by MVP Doug Williams, who set a record with 340 yards passing in the game. Washington scored the five touchdowns in 18 plays with a total time of possession of only 5:47. Williams became the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl.Tim Smith, a rookie backup who gained 126 yards for the entire season, was given the start by Redskins coach Joe Gibbs. Smith rushed for a record 204 yards. Ricky Sanders caught nine passes for 193 yards and two touchdowns, breaking one record and tying another.Just as in the 1982 season, the Redskins won the title in a season shortened by a players’ strike.___Super Bowl XXIJan. 25, 1987At Pasadena, Calif._101,063Denver10001020N.Y. Giants72171339Phil Simms led the New York Giants to a 30-point second half to beat the Denver Broncos, winning their first Super Bowl and first NFL championship in 30 years.Simms completed 22 of 25 for 268 yards, including three touchdown passes, and was unanimously voted the Most Valuable Player. He also set a Super Bowl record with 10 straight completions during New York’s second-half tear. His 88 percent completion rate was an NFL playoff record.John Elway, in his first of five Super Bowls, helped Denver to a 10-9 halftime lead. New York started the second half with three plays for 9 yards, and the Giants’ punting team ran onto the field at its 46. Suddenly, the Giants shifted out of punt formation, and Jeff Rutledge, the second-string quarterback, came up behind center to take the snap and sneak for 1 yard and a first down. Six plays later, Simms hit tight end Mark Bavaro for 13 yards, the Giants led 16-10 and the rout was on. ___Super Bowl XXJan. 26, 1986At New Orleans_73,818Chicago131021246New England300710The Monsters of the Midway in all their overpowering glory.And with some brashness: several players made a music video, the “Super Bowl Shuffle,” before heading to New Orleans.The Chicago Bears won their first NFL championship since 1963 by setting a Super Bowl record for points scored in defeating the Patriots 46-10. The NFC champions, who won by the largest margin in Super Bowl history, broke the mark for points in a game set by San Francisco and the Los Angeles Raiders in the previous two Super Bowls.New England capitalized on a Chicago fumble to score the quickest points in Super Bowl history on Tony Franklin’s field goal 74 seconds after kickoff. That just made the Bears mad, and they scored 44 straight points. The Bears’ defense, which allowed only 10 points in postseason play, held New England to 7 yards rushing and 116 yards passing.Jim McMahon, who passed for 256 yards, became the first quarterback to rush for two touchdowns. Richard Dent, who contributed 1 1/2 sacks, was voted the Most Valuable Player.Chicago all-time great running back Walter Payton didn’t score, but defensive tackle William “Refrigerator” Perry had a 1-yard TD run.___Super Bowl XIXJan. 20, 1985At Palo Alto, Calif._84,059Miami1060016San Francisco72110038Billed as a matchup of the NFL’s top two quarterbacks, Joe Montana (and his defense) easily got the better of Dan Marino.Montana completed 24 of 35 passes and threw for a Super Bowl record 331 yards and three touchdowns. He also rushed five times for 59 yards and a touchdown. Running back Roger Craig caught two of Montana’s touchdown passes and ran for another to set a Super Bowl record. The San Francisco defense sacked the record-setting Marino four times in the game and held the Dolphins to 25 yards rushing.Montana joined Green Bay’s Bart Starr and Pittsburgh’s Terry Bradshaw as the only two-time Super Bowl most valuable players. Montana was the MVP in the 1982 Super Bowl against Cincinnati.Marino would never make the Super Bowl again in his Hall of Fame career.___Super Bowl XVIIIJan. 22, 1984At Tampa, Fla._72,920Washington03609Los Angeles71414338Marcus Allen rushed for a Super Bowl-record 191 yards on 20 carries and scored two touchdowns as the Raiders trounced the Redskins, 38-9.The Raiders took a 7-0 lead 4:52 into the game when Derrick Jensen blocked Jeff Hayes’ punt and recovered it in the end zone for a touchdown.Jim Plunkett hooked up with Cliff Branch for a 12-yard TD pass and a 14-0 lead. Washington cut the margin to 14-3 on a 24-yard field goal by Mark Moseley, but with 7 seconds left in the half, Washington coach Joe Gibbs called for a screen pass. Raiders linebacker Jack Squirek saw it coming and intercepted Joe Theismann’s throw, jogging 5 yards into the end zone to give Los Angeles a commanding 21-3 halftime advantage.Allen, voted the game’s most valuable player, scored on runs of 5 and 74 yards, the latter a Super Bowl record and a brilliant effort, putting the Raiders ahead 35-9.___Super Bowl XVIIJan. 30, 1983At Pasadena, Calif._103,667Miami7100017Washington01031427Fullback John Riggins churned out a Super Bowl-record 166 yards on 38 carries to spark the Redskins to a come-from-behind 27-17 win over the Dolphins.For Riggins, voted the game’s most valuable player, it was his fourth consecutive 100-yard rushing game during the playoffs, also a record.Riggins gave the Redskins their first lead with 10:01 remaining when he ran 43 yards off left tackle for a touchdown on fourth-and-1.The Dolphins had built a 17-10 halftime lead on a 76-yard touchdown pass from David Woodley to wide receiver Jim Cefalo in the first quarter; a 20-yard field goal by Uwe von Schamann; and a Super Bowl-record 98-yard kickoff return by Fulton Walker just before halftime.Mark Moseley cut the Miami lead to 17-13 with a 20-yard field goal in the third quarter.After Riggins’ run put the Redskins on top, Theismann capped the scoring with a 6-yard pass to wide receiver Charlie Brown with 1:55 left.The Redskins and Dolphins survived a strike-shortened season to reach the Super Bowl.___Super Bowl XVIJan. 24, 1982At Pontiac, Mich._81,270San Francisco7136026Cincinnati0071421The first Super Bowl held in a cold-weather city — but in the Pontiac Silverdome — was preceded by the 49ers’ bus getting caught in traffic and several players needing to walk into the stadium.Didn’t bother them much: Ray Wersching kicked a Super Bowl record-tying four field goals to help lift the 49ers to their first NFL championship with a 26-21 win over the Bengals.The 49ers built a game-record 20-0 halftime lead on the strength of two long touchdown marches led by Joe Montana, and two Wersching field goals.The Bengals came back in the second half, narrowing the margin to 20-14 on quarterback Ken Anderson’s 5-yard run and 4-yard scoring toss to Dan Ross. But Wersching connected on early third-quarter field goals of 40 and 23 yards to increase the 49ers’ lead to 26-14, making meaningless Anderson’s 3-yard touchdown pass to Ross (who set a Super Bowl record with 11 receptions for 104 yards) in the final seconds.Montana completed 14 of 22 passes for 157 yards; Anderson established game records for completions (25) and completion percentage (73.5 percent on 25 of 34).___Super Bowl XVJan. 25, 1981At New Orleans_76,135Oakland14010327Philadelphia030710Jim Plunkett’s two first-quarter touchdown passes, including a Super Bowl-record 80-yard strike to running back Kenny King, led the Raiders.Philadelphia, which had defeated Oakland 10-7 several weeks earlier, never got on track until late in the third quarter. Linebacker Rod Martin set up Oakland’s first touchdown with his first of three interceptions, a Super Bowl record for one player.Before the first quarter ended the Raiders upped their lead to 14-0 when Plunkett hit King near midfield to record the longest play in Super Bowl history. In all, Plunkett completed 13 of 21 passes for 261 yards and three touchdowns. The game capped a storybook season for Plunkett, the game’s MVP.The journeyman quarterback took over the reins of the Raiders’ offense and won nine of the last 11 regular-season games. In the playoffs, the Raiders beat Houston, San Diego and Cleveland en route to becoming the first wild-card team to win the Super Bowl.___Super Bowl XIVJan. 20, 1980At Pasadena, Calif._103,985Los Angeles766019Pittsburgh3771431The Steel Curtain dynasty concluded as Terry Bradshaw completed 14 of 21 passes for 309 yards and set two passing records as the Steelers became the first team to win four Super Bowls.Despite three interceptions by the Rams, Bradshaw brought the Steelers from behind twice in the second half. Trailing 13-10 at halftime, Pittsburgh went ahead 17-13 when Bradshaw connected with Lynn Swann for a 47-yard touchdown early in the third quarter.On the Rams’ next possession, Vince Ferragamo responded with a 50-yard pass to Billy Waddy that moved Los Angeles to the Steelers 24. On the following play, Lawrence McCutcheon connected with Ron Smith on a halfback option pass that gave the Rams a 19-17 lead.On Pittsburgh’s initial possession of the fourth quarter, Bradshaw lofted a gorgeous 73-yard scoring pass to John Stallworth to put the Steelers in front to stay, 24-19. A 45-yard pass from Bradshaw to Stallworth was the key play in Pittsburgh’s final scoring drive, which was culminated by Franco Harris’ second 1-yard TD of the game.Bradshaw, the game’s MVP for the second straight year, set Super Bowl records for most touchdown passes (nine) and most passing yards (932).The Steelers would not win another Super Bowl for a quarter-century.___Super Bowl XIIIJan. 21, 1979At Miami_79,484Pittsburgh71401435Dallas7731431In one of the most exciting Super Bowls, Terry Bradshaw threw four touchdown passes to lead the Steelers to their third win. Bradshaw, voted the game’s most valuable player, completed 17 of 30 passes for 318 yards, breaking Bart Starr’s record of 250 yards passing by halftime.Two Bradshaw-to-John Stallworth and one Bradshaw-to-Rocky Bleier throws in the first half gave Pittsburgh a 21-14 lead at halftime.Franco Harris ran 22 yards for a score after Rafael Septein had cut Pittsburgh’s lead to 21-17 with a field goal. Pittsburgh then seemingly put the game out of reach with less than seven minutes to play when Bradshaw hit Lynn Swann for an 18-yard TD strike to make the score 35-17.But Roger Staubach threw his second scoring pass of the game with 2:23 left, a 7-yarder to Billy Joe DuPree. The Cowboys then recovered an onside kick and scored again on Staubach’s third TD pass with 22 seconds remaining.Dallas’ bid for another onside kick recovery and a miracle comeback failed as Rocky Bleier fell on the ensuing kickoff with 17 seconds left.MORE-Super Bowl XXIIIJan. 22, 1989At Miami_75,129Cincinnati0310316San Francisco3031420___Super Bowl XXIIJan. 31, 1988At San Diego_73,302Washington0350742Denver1000010___Super Bowl XXIJan. 25, 1987At Pasadena, Calif._101,063Denver10001020N.Y.

      "content": "OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) — Declan Doyle doesn’t turn 30 until next month.He’s already one of the NFL’s most important assistant coaching hires of this offseason.The Baltimore Ravens made it official Monday. They’ve hired Doyle to be their offensive coordinator. He takes over a unit that was phenomenal in 2024 before regressing this season as two-time MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson dealt with injury problems.Doyle was born almost exactly 10 months before Jackson.“An architect of offense, Declan will build around our players through communication, collaboration, relationships and trust,” Jesse Minter, who was hired to replace John Harbaugh as Baltimore’s coach, said in a statement. “His innovative mindset, collaborative spirit, team-first approach and extensive NFL experience make him an outstanding addition to the Ravens organization.” Doyle was previously the offensive coordinator for the Chicago Bears under Ben Johnson. Chicago improved into a playoff team this season, with second-year quarterback Caleb Williams taking significant steps forward.Now Doyle will have a crucial role with Baltimore, with Minter planning to call the defense. The 2024 Ravens averaged 6.85 yards per play, the third most in NFL history, and set a league record with 5.76 yards per rush.But Baltimore slipped to an 8-9 record this season and missed the playoffs, resulting in Harbaugh’s firing.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

      "content": "CHICAGO (AP) — Caleb Williams’ last throw in regulation was a backpedaling, fourth-down rainbow that landed in Cole Kmet’s hands in the corner of the end zone for a breathtaking touchdown.His last throw of the game was the beginning of the end for Chicago’s surprising season.Williams almost rallied the Bears to another memorable win on Sunday night. But he threw his third interception in overtime and Matthew Stafford drove the Los Angeles Rams to Harrison Mevis’ winning field goal in a 20-17 victory in the divisional round of the playoffs.“It’s tough. In these moments, you feel that you let your team down,” Williams said. “You feel this or that. It’s a good lesson learned for us, first time being in this situation for me and for us as a team. I’m excited for what’s to come. But obviously going to go back and watch this and figure out how I can be better, and that’s the exciting part.” The 24-year-old Williams led Chicago to an NFL-record seven wins this season when trailing in last 2 minutes of regulation. He threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore with 1:43 left in a 31-27 victory over Green Bay in the first round of the playoffs.

And, just like before, Williams delivered.Facing a fourth-and-4 at the Rams 14 with 27 seconds left, Williams took a shotgun snap and surveyed the field. The No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft was forced to backpedal as the pocket collapsed, and he scampered all the way back to the 40 with Jared Verse, Josaiah Stewart and Braden Fiske all in pursuit for the Rams. Williams turned, saw Kmet in the end zone and threw the ball in his direction just as Verse and Stewart got to the second-year QB.“I ended up getting a little bit of pressure, so try and break contain and just break angles and slow those guys down so that when I do turn around, I can have a little bit more time possibly to find somebody,” Williams said, “and they did a good job containing me, so I just gained a little bit more depth, and I saw Cole one-on-one over there.” Kmet wrestled with Rams cornerback Cobie Turner before hauling in the pass, sending a charge through the crowd of 60,253 on a frigid night at Soldier Field.“It felt like a pretty easy pitch-and-catch and kind of felt like it was in slow motion,” Kmet said. “I can’t believe Caleb.”Bears coach Ben Johnson called the throw “ridiculous.”“There’s some things that you just can’t coach. ... He’s got a knack, he’s clutch,” Johnson said.According to Next Gen Stats, Williams’ pass traveled 51.2 yards in the air for the longest completed pass by air distance in the red zone since at least 2016. He made the throw from 26.5 yards behind the line of scrimmage; no quarterback since 2016, according to Next Gen Stats, had completed a pass from a depth of more than 22 yards.It had a completion probability of 17.8%.“It was the most special throw that I’ve ever seen. I’ve seen him do that so many times this year,” Bears safety Kevin Byard said. Williams also threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Moore on fourth down on the first play of the second quarter. But his three interceptions were costly.The Bears had a chance to win the game in overtime. They drove to the Los Angeles 48 before Williams was picked off by Rams safety Kam Curl on a deep ball intended for Moore.“Just a miscommunication between him and I,” Williams said. “Tried to flatten him off under the safety, and he kept it vertical from what I saw, obviously, in the moment.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",
