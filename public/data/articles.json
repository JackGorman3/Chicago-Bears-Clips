He has more than 20 years of experience working in NFL analytics and is the creator of the DVOA and DYAR metric. He also serves as the Chief Analytics Officer at FTN Network.Follow on XMultiple AuthorsEmailPrintOpen Extended ReactionsWe're still a few days away from NFL free agency, but teams are already thinking about which new players they want to add to their rosters. The franchise tag deadline comes Tuesday, March 3, and free agency begins March 11, although the negotiation window opens two days earlier. Not every team will make a lot of moves, but every roster usually picks up at least one important veteran. Who represents the best match for each of the 32 teams?Below, I've suggested one free agent signing for each team. I set myself a couple of rules for this exercise: only one free agent for each team, and only one team for each free agent. I also didn't assign any player to return to his current team, even on the franchise tag. For example, I didn't include quarterback Daniel Jones (expected to be re-signed by the Colts).At the end, I've also included a list of additional free agents, as certainly some of these teams will sign multiple big-name free agents. Let's get started with the Bills.Jump to: ARI | ATL | BAL | BUF | CAR | CHI | CIN CLE | DAL | DEN | DET | GB | HOU | IND JAX | KC | LAC | LAR | LV | MIA | MIN NE | NO | NYG | NYJ | PHI | PIT | SF SEA | TB | TEN | WSH Top remaining free agentsAFC EASTEditor's PicksFaces who need new places: We picked 32 players who could use fresh starts with new teamsAaron Schatz32 NFL teams, 32 quarterback predictions: We named a Week 1 starter for every offenseSeth WalderNFL free agency tiers: Barnwell ranks the best QBs, RBs, WRs, TEs and OLBill BarnwellBuffalo BillsWR Mike Evans (TB)Buffalo needs a No. 1 option for quarterback Josh Allen, and Evans is still a talented \"X\" receiver. He has the size -- standing at 6-foot-5, 231 pounds -- and ball skills to win contested catches. Allen could also trust Evans on third down; in 2024, he had a team-high 220 yards on third down for the Bucs.There are doubts about Evans, however, since he will be turning 33 in August and missed 10 games in 2025 due to a broken collarbone and a hamstring injury. But he is only one year removed from a 1,000-yard season with 11 touchdowns.Miami DolphinsTE Isaiah Likely (BAL)The Dolphins' top three tight ends from last season are all free agents (Greg Dulcich, Darren Waller and Julian Hill), and they could use an upgrade at the position anyway. Waller had six touchdowns in his return from retirement, but he played only nine games due to hip and pectoral injuries.Enter Likely, who is ready to start as a No. 1 tight end after spending a few years as TE2 behind Mark Andrews in Baltimore. Last season was a bit of an off year for Likely, who had only one touchdown and dropped to 19th among tight ends in the ESPN receiver scores. But he ranked sixth in 2023 and third in 2024, with 400 yards in each of those seasons. He should be able to shine in a Miami offense that doesn't need to feed a lot of other receivers after it released Tyreek Hill and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine.New England PatriotsEdge Jaelan Phillips (PHI)The Patriots' two biggest needs this offseason are edge rusher and offensive line. On the O-line, they will likely depend on the development of young players like Will Campbell and Jared Wilson. But the edge is a good place to bring in a veteran.Phillips had two sacks and 27 pressures after he was traded to the Eagles from Miami at midseason. His 12.4% pass rush win rate ranked 24th among qualifying edge rushers. Phillips could replace free agent K'Lavon Chaisson and/or make a good partner for Harold Landry III.New York JetsQB Malik Willis (GB)Yes, it was a small sample with just one start and four total games played, but Willis had a phenomenal 93.1 QBR for the Packers in 2025. And he had an impressive 77.3 QBR in two starts the season before.Willis is going to sign somewhere to start, and the Jets need a new quarterback. Justin Fields didn't work out, and Fernando Mendoza seems to be the only QB prospect worthy of the first-round pick in April. It's unlikely Mendoza will fall past Las Vegas at No. 1.The teams Ben Solak expects to be in on Malik WillisBen Solak joins Rich Eisen to break down the interest he expects for free agent quarterback Malik Willis.AFC NORTHBaltimore RavensC Connor McGovern (BUF)The Ravens are going to need a replacement at center if Tyler Linderbaum leaves town. Why not the underrated 28-year-old McGovern, who quietly had one of the top seasons for a center in 2025? His 97.2% pass block win rate last season matched Linderbaum for second place behind Kansas City's Creed Humphrey. And McGovern's 72.6% run block win rate ranked third among all centers.Cincinnati BengalsEdge Odafe Oweh (LAC)With Trey Hendrickson probably on his way out of Cincinnati, the Bengals need an edge rusher. And with the seventh-most cap space this offseason (per Roster Management System), they're in position to rain money down on a player still in his prime.Oweh finally broke out after the Ravens traded him to the Chargers last season, with 7.5 sacks in the final 12 games and two forced fumbles in Los Angeles' playoff loss to the Patriots. The only question with the 27-year-old is whether he'll be comfortable playing with his hand in the dirt in Cincinnati after a few years as an outside linebacker in 3-4 schemes.Cleveland BrownsWR Rashid Shaheed (SEA)There's more to the return game than just having a fast return man. The blocking matters. Still, the addition of Shaheed would be a big step forward for a Browns special teams unit that I had ranked 32nd on punt return value and 28th on kick return value through my special teams DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average) in 2025.Shaheed would also be a strong downfield receiver for a unit that desperately needs improvement. Last season, starting for the Saints and then the reigning Super Bowl champions, he had seven games (including playoffs) with at least 50 receiving yards. No Browns receiver eclipsed Shaheed's 687 receiving yards in 2025.What to know for NFL free agency• Top 50 players available | Offense tiers • Picking one free agent for every team • Every team's biggest decision | Best fits • Tracking franchise tags | Read more Pittsburgh SteelersS Jaquan Brisker (CHI)Last season's safeties in Pittsburgh are free agents with the exception of DeShon Elliott and, if you want to consider him a safety, Jalen Ramsey. That's why the Steelers need to attack this packed safety free agent class.Brisker can play deep or in the box, and he's a hard-hitting safety who will fit the Steelers' defensive personality. He missed 12 games in the 2024 season due to a concussion, but he had at least 90 combined tackles in each of his three healthy NFL seasons. Over his career, Brisker has recorded seven sacks, four interceptions and four forced fumbles.AFC SOUTHHouston TexansC Tyler Linderbaum (BAL)Incumbent Jake Andrews ranked last among qualifying centers with a 92.4% pass block win rate, so this is a position where the Texans need to take a big swing. Bringing over Linderbaum, who ranked second at center with a 97.2% pass block win rate, would really help solidify the offense and keep Houston as a Super Bowl contender in 2026.Indianapolis ColtsEdge Bradley Chubb (MIA)The Colts ranked just 30th in pass rush win rate (29.1%) last season, and three of their top four pass rushers are hitting free agency. So, this is a good time to bring in a veteran. The Dolphins cut Chubb to clear money off their salary cap, but he is still just 30 years old. He had 8.5 sacks last season with 36 pressures.Jacksonville JaguarsCB Riq Woolen (SEA)Wide receiver/cornerback Travis Hunter is expected to be back at the start of 2026, but the Jaguars still need another CB starter on the outside if Montaric Brown and Greg Newsome II leave in free agency.Woolen has stirred some controversy in Seattle and was benched briefly a couple of times last season due to mistakes. But he still ranked 12th in the league in my coverage DVOA metric. He's also a larger (6-4, 210 pounds), more physical corner who could cover receivers who might be too big for the slight-framed Hunter.Breaking news from Adam SchefterDownload the ESPN app and enable Adam Schefter's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first.

Tennessee TitansEdge K'Lavon Chaisson (NE)Tennessee would have been the perfect landing spot for George Pickens, as it desperately needs a No. 1 option for quarterback Cam Ward. But since Pickens is expected to be franchise-tagged by the Cowboys, let's further strengthen the Titans' pass rush with Chaisson.Tennessee was ranked a surprising 15th in pass rush win rate (37.3%) last season, but Arden Key and Jihad Ward are both free agents. Chaisson blossomed over the past two seasons with the Raiders and then the Patriots. In 2025, he had 7.5 sacks, 32 pressures and an above-average pass rush win rate of 12.9%. The Titans could put him on the strong side across from Oluwafemi Oladejo.AFC WESTDenver BroncosTE Cade Otton (TB)Tight end is a clear need for the Broncos, so why not sign a bigger name such as David Njoku? Because the Broncos already have a receiving-first tight end in Evan Engram, and they need a No. 1 tight end who is also a strong run blocker. That's Otton. He's also useful as a receiver when needed, with 1,172 receiving yards and five touchdowns over the past two seasons.Kansas City ChiefsRB Kenneth Walker III (SEA)The Chiefs need not just a running back but a running back who can also serve as a receiving outlet for Patrick Mahomes. Walker had more than 1,000 rushing yards last season and added 31 catches for 282 yards -- an impressive 9.1 yards per reception average.His ability to generate explosive plays could be a valuable part of lifting the Chiefs' offense back to the top of the league.Will Kenneth Walker III still be with the Seahawks next season?The \"Get Up\" crew debates whether the Seahawks should do all they can to keep Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker III.Las Vegas RaidersLB Quay Walker (GB)The Raiders could use playmakers all across their defense, and both of last season's starting linebackers are free agents. Walker had 128 combined tackles with the Packers last season and has sideline-to-sideline speed to track down running backs. He can be used as a blitzer as well. The Raiders would just need to make sure their other linebacker is strong in coverage, as that's a weakness for Walker.Los Angeles ChargersG Isaac Seumalo (PIT)The Chargers will get tackles Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt back next season, but they still need big help on the interior offensive line. Left guard Zion Johnson, now a free agent, was near the bottom of the league in pass block win rate (87.4%) last season. Center Bradley Bozeman also announced his retirement Feb. 23.On the other hand, the veteran Seumalo was second among 65 qualifying guards with a 97.3% pass rush win rate and fourth with a 76.9% run block win rate. This would be a huge step toward making Los Angeles a serious Super Bowl contender.NFC EASTDallas CowboysLB Devin Lloyd (JAX)The Cowboys had one of the worst defenses in NFL history in 2025, according to my DVOA metric, and they are in desperate need of playmakers. So why not bring in Lloyd? He is a solid starting linebacker who had five interceptions and 1.5 sacks last season.New York GiantsCB Eric Stokes (LV)Cornerbacks are a tough choice in free agency because they are so inconsistent from season to season. Stokes was one of the worst cornerbacks in the league in 2024, but he transformed into one of the league's best in 2025 with 53 total tackles and five passes defensed.It's safe to say that we don't know what version of Stokes we'll see in 2026. But this is a clear position of need for the Giants, who ranked 17th in yards allowed per completion last season (10.9). They can take a chance that Stokes is closer to his 2025 play.What to know for the NFL offseason• Every team's offseason guide | Schedule • Top free agents | Best draft prospects • Top trade candidates | 11 trade proposals • QB market | Rebuild tiers | Deepest positions • Coach hirings | Draft order | Franchise tags Philadelphia EaglesEdge Boye Mafe (SEA)The Eagles could use more help on the edge to rotate with Nolan Smith Jr. and Jalyx Hunt, and Mafe had an outstanding season for the Super Bowl champions in 2025.Although Mafe had only two sacks, he added 33 pressures. His 18.7% pass rush win rate was eighth among edge rushers and his 11.4% pressure rate was 17th. Mafe is quick and still in his prime, turning 28 in late November.Washington CommandersEdge Trey Hendrickson (CIN)For the No. 1 free agent, we're looking for three things. First, a team with a gaping hole at the edge rusher position. Second, a team with a lot of cap space. Third, a legitimate playoff contender.The Commanders definitely hit that first qualifier, as three of their top four edges are free agents. They also hit the second qualifier with the sixth-most cap space, per Roster Management System. And you might not think of them as legitimate playoff contenders, but they are only one season removed from appearing in the NFC Championship Game.I think coach Dan Quinn will need to try his hardest to convince Hendrickson to come in and help improve the struggling Washington pass rush.NFC NORTHChicago BearsS Kam Curl (LAR)Both Jaquan Brisker and Kevin Byard III are free agents, so even if one of them returns, the Bears will need help at the safety position. Curl can play either deep or in the box, depending on what Chicago needs and which of their veterans is re-signed in free agency.Curl recorded two interceptions and five passes defensed in 2025, and he was tied for fifth with 79 solo tackles.Detroit LionsEdge Khalil Mack (LAC)The Lions' top need is finding pass-rush help for Aidan Hutchinson. So why not aim for an established veteran at that position? Despite sitting out five games in 2025 because of an elbow injury, Mack still finished with 5.5 sacks and 28 pressures.Detroit isn't swimming in cap space, but it should be able to convince Mack to take a pay cut so he can chase a Super Bowl ring. Mack's former Chargers teammate Joey Bosa would also fit the bill if he doesn't return to Buffalo.What to know for the 2026 NFL draft• Mocks: Kiper | Miller | Reid | Yates • Rankings: Kiper | Miller | Reid | Yates • Best by position | Draft order | More Green Bay PackersLB Nakobe Dean (PHI)The Packers are probably going to let linebacker Quay Walker leave after they declined his fifth-year option, which means they need an option to play next to Edgerrin Cooper. Dean is still only 25 years old and arguably stronger than Walker in pass coverage. Dean had four sacks, two forced fumbles and 55 total tackles last season.Minnesota VikingsS Bryan Cook (KC)Cook, a rangy safety, would be perfect playing deep in coordinator Brian Flores' zone schemes. Cook had a career-high 85 tackles in 2025 and is still only 27 years old. The Vikings were 30th in DVOA against deep passes (16 or more air yards), while the Chiefs were 15th. Cook would provide an immediate improvement in that area for Minnesota.NFC SOUTHAtlanta FalconsDL John Franklin-Myers (DEN)The Falcons are one of the teams that will need a 5-technique defensive end, with both David Onyemata and Kentavius Street hitting free agency. Franklin-Myers had a pass rush win rate of 10.1% last season, which ranked him eighth among interior defensive linemen. He also had 7.5 sacks and was strong against the run; his average run tackle came after a gain of just 1.6 yards.Carolina PanthersLB Kaden Elliss (ATL)The Panthers could use another inside linebacker to play next to Trevin Wallace, and Elliss had over 100 tackles in each of the past three seasons. He also might be the best blitzing inside linebacker in the league right now, which would give defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero a very interesting option to juice up their pass rush.As an added bonus, signing Elliss would take away from a division rival. Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich said that replacing Elliss would \"take more than one human being.\"New Orleans SaintsWR Alec Pierce (IND)The Saints ranked 31st in pass plays that gained at least 20 yards last season (5.6%). So let's give second-year quarterback Tyler Shough a great deep threat who would help their offense stretch the field.Pierce had his first 1,000-yard season on only 47 catches, averaging 21.3 yards per reception. The season before, it was 22.3 yards per reception. That deep efficiency helped him rank fourth among all wide receivers in my DYAR (defense-adjusted yards above replacement) metric in 2025.What is Alec Pierce's fantasy outlook for 2026?Matt Bowen breaks down the importance of Alec Pierce's free agency destination for his fantasy value next season.Tampa Bay BuccaneersLB Alex Anzalone (DET)The time might have finally come for 36-year-old Lavonte David to leave the Buccaneers, which opens a spot for a veteran in the middle of Tampa Bay's defense. Anzalone is strong against the run and had 2.5 sacks and eight passes defensed for Detroit last season.NFC WESTArizona CardinalsOT Braden Smith (IND)Here's the team with the biggest need for a right tackle, as both Jonah Williams and Kelvin Beachum were low in pass block win rate last season and are going to be free agents. Smith has been steady for the Colts, ranking 34th out of 68 qualifying players in pass block win rate last season (90.6%).Los Angeles RamsCB Jaylen Watson (KC)The Rams are going to have some changes in the secondary next season. Cornerbacks Cobie Durant and Ahkello Witherspoon are free agents, as is nickelback Roger McCreary, who barely played after he was picked up from Tennessee at midseason. Darious Williams is still on the roster but could use a change of scenery.Watson is a talented corner with the size (6-2, 197 pounds) to press and the awareness to play zone coverage. He had a phenomenal coverage DVOA in six games in 2024, then was above average (40th out of 98 qualifying) in a full season in 2025.Best of NFL Nation• Will Seahawks re-sign Kenneth Walker • Bills from the combine • Gaints ponder Lawrence, Thibodeaux • Why Canales turned to Izdik • What Raiders learned at combine San Francisco 49ersG Joel Bitonio (CLE)Would the 49ers be willing to put 34-year-old Bitonio next to 37-year-old Trent Williams (assuming the Niners and Williams can work out his contract situation) on the left side of their offensive line? There is an opening here, and a chance for Bitonio to finally go after a Super Bowl ring with a real contender.He ranked third among all guards with a 96.4% pass block win rate last season, and his run block win rate of 72.3% was above average. Alijah Vera-Tucker would also be an interesting signing for the 49ers if they wanted to go younger at left guard instead.Seattle SeahawksWR Jauan Jennings (SF)This signing would achieve a couple of goals for the Seahawks. It would give them a receiver to replace Rashid Shaheed if he leaves in free agency. Furthermore, Jennings is a strong run blocker and the Seahawks still want to be a run-first offense.New offensive coordinator Brian Fleury is familiar with Jennings from his time in San Francisco, and adding Jennings would bring the benefit of taking away from an important division rival. Jennings had nine touchdowns last season but was even better in 2024, when he ranked 12th in ESPN's receiver scores.Top remaining free agents not assigned to a team:RB Travis Etienne Jr. (JAX)WR Tyreek Hill (MIA)TE David Njoku (CLE)OT Rasheed Walker (GB)G David Edwards (BUF)G Alijah Vera-Tucker (NYJ)Edge Joey Bosa (BUF)CB Jamel Dean (TB)CB Alontae Taylor (NO)S Kevin Byard III (CHI)",

      "content": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) — The Chicago Bears have promoted pass game coordinator Press Taylor to offensive coordinator to replace the departed Declan Doyle, one of four coaching moves announced by the team on Wednesday.Taylor was Jacksonville’s offensive coordinator from 2022 to 2024. His promotion comes after Doyle left to call plays in Baltimore under new Ravens coach Jesse Minter.Coach Ben Johnson will continue to call plays after the Bears made the playoffs in his first season. Chicago’s offense ranked sixth overall, with quarterback Caleb Williams making big strides in his second year. The No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft, he threw for a franchise-record 3,942 yards with 27 touchdowns and seven interceptions.The Bears were third in rushing, with D’Andre Swift and rookie Kyle Monangai leading the way. Chicago also committed a league-low 11 turnovers. The Bears also hired Eric Studesville as running backs coach, Will Lawing as offensive analyst and Isaiah Ford as offensive quality control coach. A 29-year NFL coaching veteran, Studesville was a Bears assistant in the late 1990s and spent the past eight seasons in Miami, working alongside Johnson for part of that time. Studesville takes over for Eric Bieniemy, who left to become Kansas City’s offensive coordinator.

      "content": "GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Green Bay general manager Brian Gutekunst remains optimistic about the Packers’ long-term outlook as they head into the offseason after a gut-wrenching playoff loss to the Chicago Bears.But he acknowledges they must do a much better job of finishing games.Gutekunst spoke to reporters Wednesday for the first time since the Packers signed him as well as coach Matt LaFleur and executive vice president/director of football operations Russ Ball to multiyear contract extensions last week. The move by new Packers team president/CEO Ed Policy keeps the Packers’ football leadership triad intact despite a string of disappointing postseason defeats.“In every season, there’s successes, and there’s failures and there’s disappointments,” Gutekunst said. “I was proud of our team in a lot of areas this year, but finishing games is certainly something that we got to concentrate on as we head into 2026.” The Packers (9-8-1) dropped their final five games, including a 31-27 wild-card loss to the Bears in which they blew a 21-3 halftime lead and allowed 25 fourth-quarter points.Green Bay hasn’t reached the Super Bowl since the 2010 team — assembled by GM Ted Thompson, coached by Mike McCarthy and quarterbacked by four-time NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers — won it all. And the team has won only one playoff game since ending the 2020 season with an NFC championship game loss to Tom Brady and the eventual Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Related Stories All eyes focused on Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza as QBs take center stage at NFL scouting combine 4 MIN READ Packers hire Cam Achord as special teams coordinator following Rich Bisaccia’s departure 1 MIN READ Falcons dismiss assistant coach LaTroy Lewis, who has been named a suspect in a sexual assault case 2 MIN READ The final loss to the Bears came after the Packers went 9-3-1 to start the season and had a four-point lead entering the fourth quarter of a 34-26 loss to the Denver Broncos on Dec. 14. The Packers had won four in a row at that point, but they watched No. 1 wide receiver Christian Watson leave the stadium in an ambulance after suffering a chest injury, then lost All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons to a torn ACL in his left knee later in the game. While Watson returned the following week, Parsons was lost for the season, just as the team had lost emerging star tight end Tucker Kraft to an ACL tear in his right knee in a Nov. 2 loss to the Carolina Panthers.“We were 9-3-1, and I didn’t think we had played particularly great football during the season. I thought we had moments, but I thought we had an opportunity to round into form there in the second half of the season,” Gutekunst said. “And obviously it didn’t work out that way.”And now, the Packers face a challenging offseason full of potential change. Not only did they lose defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, who left to become the Miami Dolphins head coach, but they have a number of starters and key contributors from their 2022 draft class set to hit free agency in March.Those players who could leave include left tackle Rasheed Walker, middle linebacker Quay Walker, center/guard Sean Rhyan and wide receiver Romeo Doubs. Prized backup quarterback Malik Willis, who played well in place of an injured Jordan Love, also is a free agent and could land a starting opportunity elsewhere. “We have one goal here, and we never run from it. We’re here to win championships,” Gutekunst said. “And I think this team is capable of that.“(The) 2026 (team) will be a different team, but the expectations won’t change. Again, I thought there’s some really good things during the (2025) season. There also were some major disappointments. But I really do like the guys we have in that locker room, the guys that are coming back, and we’ll continue to add to that. And we’re all excited to get at it.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

      "content": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) — The Chicago Bears thrilled the city in coach Ben Johnson’s first season. They pulled out one comeback win after another on their way to capturing the NFC North championship after finishing last in the division. They advanced in the playoffs for the first time in 15 years by rallying to beat Green Bay in a wild-card game before losing an overtime thriller to Matthew Stafford and the Los Angeles Rams in the divisional round.Now, it’s time to start building on everything they accomplished. Then again, maybe building isn’t the right word.“There is no building off of this,” Johnson said on Wednesday. “We go back to square one. We’re back at the bottom again. That’s really all 32 teams. If you feel otherwise, you’re probably missing the big picture.”The Bears are obviously starting from a stronger position, with Caleb Williams on his way to becoming a franchise quarterback after setting the team’s single-season passing record in his second year and Johnson looking like the coach to lead him to that next level. It’s a big change from last January, when the team was reeling after finishing 5-12 and firing former coach Matt Eberflus along the way. Now, for the first time since he was hired in 2022, general manager Ryan Poles heads into the offseason with a contender rather than a rebuilding project.

You’re gonna identify the guys that fit what we want in our football team, which coach hit, and you just keep trying to acquire those players. We know what they look like, we know how they act, we know how they talk, and we’ll continue to do that.” Poles had a big offseason a year ago.He transformed a struggling offensive line by trading for guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson and signing center Drew Dalman. He also drafted Ozzy Trapilo in the second round. The Boston College product emerged as the starting left tackle, only to tear the patellar tendon in his left knee in the wild-card game against Green Bay. Poles didn’t have a specific timeline for his return, though he figures to be out long term after having surgery.“I’m sure it’ll be deep into next (season), with the injury,” Poles said. “So, we’ve had a conversation with him. He knows this is part of his journey that he has to overcome. I have a lot of faith in him and our staff to get him back ready to go whenever that is.”Trapilo was one of four major contributors drafted by Poles this past year.The Bears also hit big with tight end Colston Loveland in the first round, receiver Luther Burden in the second and running back Kyle Monangai in the seventh. Loveland, the No. 10 pick out of Michigan, led Chicago in receptions (58) and yards (713) and tied for the team lead in touchdown catches (six). The speedy and elusive Burden had 652 yards receiving. And the hard-running Monangai rushed for 783 yards as part of a productive tandem with D’Andre Swift.The Bears have some decisions to make at safety with All-Pro Kevin Byard and Jaquan Brisker set to become free agents. The 32-year-old Byard, who led the league with seven interceptions, said this week he’d like to return. And Poles would like to have him back. “I have no problem saying that’s a player that we would like to have back,” Poles said. “But, again, when you add the other safeties into that mix and all the other decisions we have across the roster, with cap restraints and things like that, it’ll be a challenge. But that’s part of what we do.”Poles also acknowledged a need to improve the line on a defense that ranked 29th overall and 27th against the run. Chicago tied for 22nd in sacks with 35. But the Bears appear to have the two most important pieces in place — the coach and the quarterback.“I’m really encouraged about the steps he took this year,” Johnson said. “I’m Caleb Williams’ No. 1 believer. I have a lot of faith in him and what he’s capable of doing and the player that he’s still striving to become.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

      "content": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) — There were all sorts of thoughts running through Caleb Williams’ mind as he drove home after the Chicago Bears’ gut-wrenching playoff exit.One thing that jarred him was the realization that instead of reviewing video on Monday, he and his teammates would be clearing out their lockers. Williams also felt a strong sense of gratitude in the wake of the Bears’ 20-17 overtime loss to the Los Angeles Rams in the divisional round on Sunday night.“To bring life, to bring joy, to bring excitement, to being a Chicago Bears fan, to be able to cheer for us,” Williams said Monday. “I do take pride in it. It’s really cool, honestly, to be able to have those small things like that. Just being able to have the city behind you. You lose that game, you’re walking out of the game and the fans stand up and cheer and roar in a tough moment. It goes a long way.” The Bears came a long way under first-year coach Ben Johnson. They went 11-6 and won their first NFC North title since 2018 after finishing last a year ago and advanced in the playoffs for the first time in 15 years. Along the way, they provided plenty of thrills.

And on Sunday, it looked like the Bears might have one more rally in them. Williams made an incredible touchdown throw in the closing seconds of regulation. But on his last pass of the game, a miscommunication with DJ Moore led to an interception. Matthew Stafford then drove the Rams into position for the winning field goal.Instead of preparing for a trip to Seattle for the NFC championship game, Chicago turns its attention toward the offseason. The Bears are in a far better place than they were a year ago. Williams looks to improve his accuracyWilliams made big strides in his second season and first in Johnson’s system, passing for a franchise-record 3,942 yards with 27 touchdowns and seven interceptions. His accuracy remains an issue, and that’s something he plans to address in the offseason.Williams completed 58.1% of his passes and ranked 24th among qualifying players. The only other quarterback below 60% was Tennessee’s Cam Ward at 59.8%.“Was I too far forward? Was I too far back?” Williams said. “Was I not consistent enough with my footwork and did I lean off and fall off the mound, is what we call it? Things like that.”Bears are set along the offensive lineThe Bears don’t have to worry about their offensive line this offseason. That’s a big change from recent years.General manager Ryan Poles rebuilt the interior of the line by trading for guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson and signing center Drew Dalman. He also drafted Ozzy Trapilo in the second round.Thuney, acquired from Kansas City, was first-team All-Pro for the third time. Dalman earned his first Pro Bowl selection. Jackson started every game, and Trapilo emerged as the starting left tackle during the season. With Darnell Wright, a second-team All-Pro, at right tackle, the Bears’ line was one of the league’s best. All five players are under contract for next year.“We just had exit interviews — like you talk to the coaches and you have a clear view of, here are my deficiencies, here’s what needs to get better and what do we need to do as a group better,” Dalman said. “And so I think when you have all those guys that experienced those mistakes together in the past, it makes it all the more like poignant next year when we’re trying to address them.”Improving defensive line could be a focusThe Bears could use some help up front on defense. They were prone to giving up long drives, and when it came to taking down the quarterback, they were near the bottom of the NFL. With 35 sacks, they finished in a five-way tie for 22nd place. Turnover at safety?Safeties Kevin Byard and Jaquan Brisker are on expiring contracts. The 32-yeard-old Byard said he “would love” to re-sign with the Bears, with his two-year contract set to expire following one of his best seasons. He earned his third first-team All-Pro selection while leading the NFL in interceptions for the second time in his career. He picked off seven passes, one shy of his career high with Tennessee in 2017.Byard said he wanted to prove he was still an elite player when he signed with Chicago after being released by Philadelphia. He played a huge role in the Bears leading the league in interceptions (23), takeaways (33) and turnover differential (plus-22).“I really enjoyed this season and I would love to be back,” he said.Brisker stayed healthy in his fourth season, playing a career-high 17 games after missing the final 12 in 2024 due to a concussion. He had a sack and two passes defensed against Los Angeles.Next stepsThe Bears are bullish on their future. They believe they have the right coach and quarterback, and they can now entice free agents to join a winner.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

Jim Breech’s 40-yard field goal, with 3:20 remaining gave Cincinnati a 16-13 lead.San Francisco started the winning drive at its 8-yard line, with quarterback Joe Montana (“Joe Cool”) famously scanning the crowd at the beginning of the march and telling his teammates, “Look, there’s John Candy.”Then Montana took apart Cincinnati’s defense. On the 11th play of the series, Montana hit John Taylor with a 10-yard pass over middle for the winning touchdown with 34 seconds remaining.At halftime, the score was 3-3, the first time in Super Bowl history the game was tied at intermission. Both teams exchanged field goals and Stanford Jennings’ 93-yard kickoff return gave the Bengals a 13-6 lead with 4 seconds remaining in the third quarter. The 49ers came back with an 85-yard drive in four plays, concluding with Montana’s 14-yard pass to Jerry Rice. Rice was voted the most valuable player after catching 11 passes for a record 215 yards. Montana completed 23 of 36 passes for a record 357 yards. ___Super Bowl XXIIJan. 31, 1988At San Diego_73,302Washington0350742Denver1000010The Washington Redskins, with the greatest quarter in NFL playoff history, scored 35 points in the second period to overcome a 10-0 deficit and win their second Super Bowl championship. John Elway threw a 56-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Nattiel on the Broncos’ first play from scrimmage and Rich Karlis kicked a 24-yard field goal on the next possession to take a 10-0 lead.The Redskins scored five touchdowns on consecutive possessions in the second quarter, four on passes by MVP Doug Williams, who set a record with 340 yards passing in the game. Washington scored the five touchdowns in 18 plays with a total time of possession of only 5:47. Williams became the first African-American quarterback to win a Super Bowl.Tim Smith, a rookie backup who gained 126 yards for the entire season, was given the start by Redskins coach Joe Gibbs. Smith rushed for a record 204 yards. Ricky Sanders caught nine passes for 193 yards and two touchdowns, breaking one record and tying another.Just as in the 1982 season, the Redskins won the title in a season shortened by a players’ strike.___Super Bowl XXIJan. 25, 1987At Pasadena, Calif._101,063Denver10001020N.Y. Giants72171339Phil Simms led the New York Giants to a 30-point second half to beat the Denver Broncos, winning their first Super Bowl and first NFL championship in 30 years.Simms completed 22 of 25 for 268 yards, including three touchdown passes, and was unanimously voted the Most Valuable Player. He also set a Super Bowl record with 10 straight completions during New York’s second-half tear. His 88 percent completion rate was an NFL playoff record.John Elway, in his first of five Super Bowls, helped Denver to a 10-9 halftime lead. New York started the second half with three plays for 9 yards, and the Giants’ punting team ran onto the field at its 46. Suddenly, the Giants shifted out of punt formation, and Jeff Rutledge, the second-string quarterback, came up behind center to take the snap and sneak for 1 yard and a first down. Six plays later, Simms hit tight end Mark Bavaro for 13 yards, the Giants led 16-10 and the rout was on. ___Super Bowl XXJan. 26, 1986At New Orleans_73,818Chicago131021246New England300710The Monsters of the Midway in all their overpowering glory.And with some brashness: several players made a music video, the “Super Bowl Shuffle,” before heading to New Orleans.The Chicago Bears won their first NFL championship since 1963 by setting a Super Bowl record for points scored in defeating the Patriots 46-10. The NFC champions, who won by the largest margin in Super Bowl history, broke the mark for points in a game set by San Francisco and the Los Angeles Raiders in the previous two Super Bowls.New England capitalized on a Chicago fumble to score the quickest points in Super Bowl history on Tony Franklin’s field goal 74 seconds after kickoff. That just made the Bears mad, and they scored 44 straight points. The Bears’ defense, which allowed only 10 points in postseason play, held New England to 7 yards rushing and 116 yards passing.Jim McMahon, who passed for 256 yards, became the first quarterback to rush for two touchdowns. Richard Dent, who contributed 1 1/2 sacks, was voted the Most Valuable Player.Chicago all-time great running back Walter Payton didn’t score, but defensive tackle William “Refrigerator” Perry had a 1-yard TD run.___Super Bowl XIXJan. 20, 1985At Palo Alto, Calif._84,059Miami1060016San Francisco72110038Billed as a matchup of the NFL’s top two quarterbacks, Joe Montana (and his defense) easily got the better of Dan Marino.Montana completed 24 of 35 passes and threw for a Super Bowl record 331 yards and three touchdowns. He also rushed five times for 59 yards and a touchdown. Running back Roger Craig caught two of Montana’s touchdown passes and ran for another to set a Super Bowl record. The San Francisco defense sacked the record-setting Marino four times in the game and held the Dolphins to 25 yards rushing.Montana joined Green Bay’s Bart Starr and Pittsburgh’s Terry Bradshaw as the only two-time Super Bowl most valuable players. Montana was the MVP in the 1982 Super Bowl against Cincinnati.Marino would never make the Super Bowl again in his Hall of Fame career.___Super Bowl XVIIIJan. 22, 1984At Tampa, Fla._72,920Washington03609Los Angeles71414338Marcus Allen rushed for a Super Bowl-record 191 yards on 20 carries and scored two touchdowns as the Raiders trounced the Redskins, 38-9.The Raiders took a 7-0 lead 4:52 into the game when Derrick Jensen blocked Jeff Hayes’ punt and recovered it in the end zone for a touchdown.Jim Plunkett hooked up with Cliff Branch for a 12-yard TD pass and a 14-0 lead. Washington cut the margin to 14-3 on a 24-yard field goal by Mark Moseley, but with 7 seconds left in the half, Washington coach Joe Gibbs called for a screen pass. Raiders linebacker Jack Squirek saw it coming and intercepted Joe Theismann’s throw, jogging 5 yards into the end zone to give Los Angeles a commanding 21-3 halftime advantage.Allen, voted the game’s most valuable player, scored on runs of 5 and 74 yards, the latter a Super Bowl record and a brilliant effort, putting the Raiders ahead 35-9.___Super Bowl XVIIJan. 30, 1983At Pasadena, Calif._103,667Miami7100017Washington01031427Fullback John Riggins churned out a Super Bowl-record 166 yards on 38 carries to spark the Redskins to a come-from-behind 27-17 win over the Dolphins.For Riggins, voted the game’s most valuable player, it was his fourth consecutive 100-yard rushing game during the playoffs, also a record.Riggins gave the Redskins their first lead with 10:01 remaining when he ran 43 yards off left tackle for a touchdown on fourth-and-1.The Dolphins had built a 17-10 halftime lead on a 76-yard touchdown pass from David Woodley to wide receiver Jim Cefalo in the first quarter; a 20-yard field goal by Uwe von Schamann; and a Super Bowl-record 98-yard kickoff return by Fulton Walker just before halftime.Mark Moseley cut the Miami lead to 17-13 with a 20-yard field goal in the third quarter.After Riggins’ run put the Redskins on top, Theismann capped the scoring with a 6-yard pass to wide receiver Charlie Brown with 1:55 left.The Redskins and Dolphins survived a strike-shortened season to reach the Super Bowl.___Super Bowl XVIJan. 24, 1982At Pontiac, Mich._81,270San Francisco7136026Cincinnati0071421The first Super Bowl held in a cold-weather city — but in the Pontiac Silverdome — was preceded by the 49ers’ bus getting caught in traffic and several players needing to walk into the stadium.Didn’t bother them much: Ray Wersching kicked a Super Bowl record-tying four field goals to help lift the 49ers to their first NFL championship with a 26-21 win over the Bengals.The 49ers built a game-record 20-0 halftime lead on the strength of two long touchdown marches led by Joe Montana, and two Wersching field goals.The Bengals came back in the second half, narrowing the margin to 20-14 on quarterback Ken Anderson’s 5-yard run and 4-yard scoring toss to Dan Ross. But Wersching connected on early third-quarter field goals of 40 and 23 yards to increase the 49ers’ lead to 26-14, making meaningless Anderson’s 3-yard touchdown pass to Ross (who set a Super Bowl record with 11 receptions for 104 yards) in the final seconds.Montana completed 14 of 22 passes for 157 yards; Anderson established game records for completions (25) and completion percentage (73.5 percent on 25 of 34).___Super Bowl XVJan. 25, 1981At New Orleans_76,135Oakland14010327Philadelphia030710Jim Plunkett’s two first-quarter touchdown passes, including a Super Bowl-record 80-yard strike to running back Kenny King, led the Raiders.Philadelphia, which had defeated Oakland 10-7 several weeks earlier, never got on track until late in the third quarter. Linebacker Rod Martin set up Oakland’s first touchdown with his first of three interceptions, a Super Bowl record for one player.Before the first quarter ended the Raiders upped their lead to 14-0 when Plunkett hit King near midfield to record the longest play in Super Bowl history. In all, Plunkett completed 13 of 21 passes for 261 yards and three touchdowns. The game capped a storybook season for Plunkett, the game’s MVP.The journeyman quarterback took over the reins of the Raiders’ offense and won nine of the last 11 regular-season games. In the playoffs, the Raiders beat Houston, San Diego and Cleveland en route to becoming the first wild-card team to win the Super Bowl.___Super Bowl XIVJan. 20, 1980At Pasadena, Calif._103,985Los Angeles766019Pittsburgh3771431The Steel Curtain dynasty concluded as Terry Bradshaw completed 14 of 21 passes for 309 yards and set two passing records as the Steelers became the first team to win four Super Bowls.Despite three interceptions by the Rams, Bradshaw brought the Steelers from behind twice in the second half. Trailing 13-10 at halftime, Pittsburgh went ahead 17-13 when Bradshaw connected with Lynn Swann for a 47-yard touchdown early in the third quarter.On the Rams’ next possession, Vince Ferragamo responded with a 50-yard pass to Billy Waddy that moved Los Angeles to the Steelers 24. On the following play, Lawrence McCutcheon connected with Ron Smith on a halfback option pass that gave the Rams a 19-17 lead.On Pittsburgh’s initial possession of the fourth quarter, Bradshaw lofted a gorgeous 73-yard scoring pass to John Stallworth to put the Steelers in front to stay, 24-19. A 45-yard pass from Bradshaw to Stallworth was the key play in Pittsburgh’s final scoring drive, which was culminated by Franco Harris’ second 1-yard TD of the game.Bradshaw, the game’s MVP for the second straight year, set Super Bowl records for most touchdown passes (nine) and most passing yards (932).The Steelers would not win another Super Bowl for a quarter-century.___Super Bowl XIIIJan. 21, 1979At Miami_79,484Pittsburgh71401435Dallas7731431In one of the most exciting Super Bowls, Terry Bradshaw threw four touchdown passes to lead the Steelers to their third win. Bradshaw, voted the game’s most valuable player, completed 17 of 30 passes for 318 yards, breaking Bart Starr’s record of 250 yards passing by halftime.Two Bradshaw-to-John Stallworth and one Bradshaw-to-Rocky Bleier throws in the first half gave Pittsburgh a 21-14 lead at halftime.Franco Harris ran 22 yards for a score after Rafael Septein had cut Pittsburgh’s lead to 21-17 with a field goal. Pittsburgh then seemingly put the game out of reach with less than seven minutes to play when Bradshaw hit Lynn Swann for an 18-yard TD strike to make the score 35-17.But Roger Staubach threw his second scoring pass of the game with 2:23 left, a 7-yarder to Billy Joe DuPree. The Cowboys then recovered an onside kick and scored again on Staubach’s third TD pass with 22 seconds remaining.Dallas’ bid for another onside kick recovery and a miracle comeback failed as Rocky Bleier fell on the ensuing kickoff with 17 seconds left.MORE-Super Bowl XXIIIJan. 22, 1989At Miami_75,129Cincinnati0310316San Francisco3031420___Super Bowl XXIIJan. 31, 1988At San Diego_73,302Washington0350742Denver1000010___Super Bowl XXIJan. 25, 1987At Pasadena, Calif._101,063Denver10001020N.Y.

      "content": "OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) — Declan Doyle doesn’t turn 30 until next month.He’s already one of the NFL’s most important assistant coaching hires of this offseason.The Baltimore Ravens made it official Monday. They’ve hired Doyle to be their offensive coordinator. He takes over a unit that was phenomenal in 2024 before regressing this season as two-time MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson dealt with injury problems.Doyle was born almost exactly 10 months before Jackson.“An architect of offense, Declan will build around our players through communication, collaboration, relationships and trust,” Jesse Minter, who was hired to replace John Harbaugh as Baltimore’s coach, said in a statement. “His innovative mindset, collaborative spirit, team-first approach and extensive NFL experience make him an outstanding addition to the Ravens organization.” Doyle was previously the offensive coordinator for the Chicago Bears under Ben Johnson. Chicago improved into a playoff team this season, with second-year quarterback Caleb Williams taking significant steps forward.Now Doyle will have a crucial role with Baltimore, with Minter planning to call the defense. The 2024 Ravens averaged 6.85 yards per play, the third most in NFL history, and set a league record with 5.76 yards per rush.But Baltimore slipped to an 8-9 record this season and missed the playoffs, resulting in Harbaugh’s firing.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

      "content": "CHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago Bears have agreed to let linebacker Tremaine Edmunds seek a trade, agent Todd France said Wednesday.The 27-year-old Edmunds is entering the final season of a four-year, $72 million contract he signed in 2023 and could be released if he doesn’t find a trade partner. He has a $17.4 million salary cap hit for next season, but the Bears would save $15 million in cap space by letting him go before the start of the league year next month. The Chicago Tribune first reported the Bears have agreed to allow Edmunds to seek a trade.Edmunds helped the Bears go from worst to first in the NFC North. He led the team with 112 tackles despite missing four games with a groin injury and had four interceptions.Chicago went 11-6 and won its first division title since 2018 after finishing last in the NFC North the previous season. The Bears advanced in the playoffs for the first time in 15 years, rallying to beat Green Bay in a wild-card thriller before losing to the Los Angeles Rams in overtime in the divisional round.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",
