Bears 2025 position review: Defensive line
BY GABBY HAJDUK, chicagobears.com

While the Bears defensive line dealt with
myriad injuries throughout the season,
several players stepped up, particularly
late in the year.
Montez Sweat led the group with 10.0
sacks, 18 quarterback hits, 13 tackles-
for-loss and three forced fumbles, which
equaled his career best. It marked the
second time Sweat reached double-digit
sacks in his career (2023), and his first
time doing so with one team.
The majority of Sweat&#39;s production
occurred after the bye week, something
coach Ben Johnson repeatedly discussed as
a difference maker for the Bears defense.
&quot;He&#39;s a guy that we count on,&quot; Johnson
said late in the season. &quot;I know the sack
numbers is what everybody looks at when
it comes to edge rushers, and he&#39;s at
double digits. He&#39;s played really good
football in that regard, but as I&#39;ve told
him, as the year has gone along, for me
it&#39;s not just the sacks, it&#39;s also the
pressures and the quarterback hits.
&quot;When you&#39;re watching from the sideline
and you&#39;re feeling him affecting the
quarterback, a different type of way I do
think that&#39;s really important. He&#39;s
stepped up. I&#39;ve felt like that since the
bye week. He&#39;s playing really good in the
running game – that gets overlooked – but
also in the passing game. I felt him get
after the quarterback a little bit more.&quot;
Sweat recorded his best performance Nov.
23 in a 31-28 win over Pittsburgh.
Heading into the Week 12 game, the
veteran had recorded a sack in four of
the previous five contests and tallied
two more against the Steelers, including
a strip-sack which he recovered himself.
Sweat also made an impact in the Bears&#39;
two playoff games, playing a season-high
82.1% of snaps against the Rams and 80.3%
of snaps, his third highest, against the
Packers. In the Wild Card Round, he
recorded three quarterback hits and a
batted pass and registered a sack of LosAngeles quarterback Matthew Stafford in
the Divisional Round.
&quot;I thought Sweat did a good job this
year,&quot; general manager Ryan Poles said.
&quot;I think sometimes we get hung up on
sacks, and sacks are important. He did
get into double digits, but I think his
all-around game was good. The way he
defended the run, defended the perimeter,
as well as applied pressure, was good. We
need him to continue to get better, too.&quot;
In the first half of the season, veteran
Dayo Odeyingbo played opposite Sweat and
recorded 21 tackles, 1.0 sack and four QB
hits before suffering an Achilles injury
against the Bengals Nov. 2 that sidelines
him for the remainder of the season.
Odeyingbo&#39;s last game of the season was
the first action for Austin Booker after
the second-year pro started the season on
injured reserve. Booker had shown promise
in the preseason, leading the league with
4.0 sacks, but sustained a knee injury
and was placed on injured reserve to
start the season.
After recording his first sack of the
season in Cincinnati, Booker started the
remaining nine regular-season games and
two postseason contests, totaling 5.5
sacks and 14 QB hits in 12 games and
routinely playing the most snaps of any
player on the defensive line. The Kansas
product came alive late in the year,
starting with a two-sack performance
against the Browns Dec. 14.
&quot;I think [Booker] continues to get better
each and every week,&quot; defensive
coordinator Dennis Allen said late in the
season. &quot;I know I&#39;ve said this before,
but the thing that I like about that
player is his toughness, his grittiness,
his tenacity. He plays extremely hard on
every single play. And I think that&#39;s
what allows him to be effective.&quot;
Booker was also instrumental in the
Bears&#39; regular-season and playoff wins
over Green Bay, totaling 13 tackles, 1.5sacks and three QB hits between the two
contests.
The Bears also had saw contributions from
veteran edge rushers Dominque Robinson,
Joe Tryon-Shoyinka and Daniel Hardy.
Veterans Grady Jarrett and Andrew
Billings, as well as third-year pro
Gervon Dexter Sr., manned the interior
defensive line for the majority of the
season. Both Billings and Dexter appeared
in all 17 games, while Jarrett missed
just three due to injury.
Dexter led the group of defensive tackles
with 44 tackles, 6.0 sacks, 11
quarterback hits, two fumble recoveries
and tied Billings with six tackles-for-
loss. Jarrett and Billings combined for
13 quarterback hits and 2.5 sacks.
Rookie defensive lineman Shemar Turner
contributed in five games before
suffering a season-ending ACL injury in
Baltimore Oct. 26. At his end-of-season
press conference, general manager Ryan
Poles told reporters he expects both
Odeyingbo and Turner back in some
capacity during the offseason program.
&quot;There&#39;s a lot going on there just in
terms of we had some injuries going on
that you have to overcome," Poles said.
"I think that&#39;s an area where we can
continue to press and get better. I look
forward to Shemar getting back and Dayo
getting back."
