Bears face big free agent decisions
BY MICHAL DWOJAK, DAILY HERALD

It’s time for the Bears to move on.
Head coach Ben Johnson and general
manager Ryan Poles will spend the
offseason looking to make moves to help
the Bears take another big step next
season.
Some of the key decisions will be what to
do with the free agents on their roster.
The Bears will likely have to make some
tough salary cap decisions and won’t
franchise tag any of their free agents.
Teams can start negotiating with
unrestricted free agents on March 9 and
officially sign players on March 11 when
the new league starts. Here’s a look at
three key players on the Bears’ roster
who are set to become free agents next
month.
Kevin Byard
Byard was one of four safeties on the
Bears roster who entered 2025 on the last
year of their contract with something to
prove. He did so and more as Byard showed
he can be an impact player even as he
entered the second half of his career.
Byard was a leader for a secondary that
helped the defense lead the league in
takeaways and interceptions. He led the
NFL with a career-high seven
interceptions while playing at 32 years
old. That strong play earned Byard his
third All-Pro and Pro Bowl honors.
It happened as Byard invested time in the
film room to create those turnovers.
Byard studied quarterbacks’ tendencies to
make up for any physical parts of his
games that might’ve slowed down.
Now the Bears need to decide whether to
bring back Byard. There likely won’t be a
top-dollar market even after Byard’s
career year because of his age. Both
parties were open to a reunion at the end
of the season and both would likely be
open to a return if it made sense for
both sides.
Nahshon Wright
Not much was expected when the Bears
signed Wright to a one-year contract last
offseason. Chicago was Wright’s third team in five years and he came to the
team because of a previous relationship
with Bears defensive backs/passing game
coordinator Al Harris.
But Wright stepped in when the Bears
needed him to and lived up to his
potential when he started in place for
injured Jaylon Johnson for most of the
season. His length helped him haul in a
career-high five interceptions, which
tied for second in the NFL. Wright also
forced two fumbles, none more memorable
than against the Philadelphia Eagles on a
“tush push” play. He earned his first Pro
Bowl honor.
It will be interesting to see what
Wright’s market looks like in free
agency. Wright finally showed that he
could create turnovers, but opponents
also picked on him at times in coverage
for big gains.
Even with that, Wright is likely in store
for a big payday in free agency. Given
what the Bears have with the return of
Jaylon Johnson and Tyrique Stevenson,
along with the uncertainty of Zah
Frazier, who missed his entire rookie
season for personal reasons, it seems
unlikely the Bears would pay up to keep
Wright.
Jaquan Brisker
Brisker was another Bears safety who had
something to prove in a contract year.
His was for a different reason, though.
The major question heading into the
season for Brisker was whether he could
play an entire season. Brisker failed to
do so during his first two seasons and
then missed the last 12 games of 2024
because of a concussion. It was the
latest in a few diagnosed concussions
Brisker suffered during his career.
Brisker proved he could stay on the field
by playing in every game for the first
time in his career. He flashed the
potential of his draft status as a former
second-round pick. Brisker finished the
season with one interception and sack,
ending the year with his best game in the
NFC divisional round.
